*Fearless Salary Negotiation* by [Josh Doody](/about/) walks you through every phase of the interview and salary negotiation processes, and it's packed with specific tactics so you always know what to do next. That's why it quickly became a #1 Best Seller on Amazon.

## Where should you start?

If you have a job interview coming up, start with [How to ace your next interview](/book/interview/interview-preparation/). If you already have a job offer, start with [How to negotiate your new salary](/book/negotiate/salary-negotiation-strategy-overview/).

If you're happy where you are but want more from your current job, start with [How to get your next raise](/book/raise/how-to-ask-for-a-raise-at-work/).

## Why am I giving this away for free?

I like [helping people](/results/), and this is another way I can help people by making sure everyone has access to my book.

Some people will be happy reading the book for free online, and others are happy to pay for their own copy of the [paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0692568689).

And for High Earners considering [expert salary negotiation coaching](/coach/) this is a great way to show them that I know what I'm talking about.

My book is the *foundation* for everything else I offer, and those other things are very valuable.
