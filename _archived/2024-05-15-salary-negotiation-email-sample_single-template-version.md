A salary negotiation email is the best way to ask for a higher salary or other benefits before beginning a new job. You may only get one opportunity to negotiate your new salary before you're an employee, so you want to make it count.

In this article, you'll get the _exact_ email template that I used to negotiate my own salary, that has helped hundreds of my [coaching clients](/coach/) negotiate a combined $15,000,000+ in additional compensation, and that thousands more people have used to negotiate their _own_ job offers.

I lost count a long time ago, but I estimate that the email template below has earned people more than $20,000,000 in additional income and probably _a lot_ more.

## <a name="salary-negotiation-email-how-to">How to use this template to write your salary negotiation email

The best way to show you how to write your salary negotiation email is to walk through each section of the template so you know how to adapt it for your own situation.

Each component is important!

### <a name="video-walkthrough">Video walkthrough
	
If you prefer a video walkthrough, here's a video walkthrough of this template where I'll show you each component and tell you how I use this template with my clients (or just keep reading).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ewvg9gEhsE?rel=0" title="Salary Negotiation Email Template Walkthrough" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### <a name="subject">Subject

Make sure to include your name and some indication that it is about your salary negotiation so you can be sure your recruiter doesn't miss your counter offer, and so you can easily find it later if you need it.

You may be able to reply directly to an email from your recruiter, or you can start a new email thread with a new subject.

### <a name="opening">Open with a greeting

Including a personal comment like "I hope you had a great weekend!" can help build rapport with the recruiter.  It's good to make it clear that you are working _with_ them as a collaborator on the salary negotiation process. You want them to _want_ to help you!

### <a name="hint">Suggest you're counter offering, but do not name the amount yet

Cut to the chase: You're going to negotiate.

Don't state your counter offer yet because because you want to make your case _before_ you make a specific "ask". Making your case is a major component of your salary negotiation email, and it will take up a lot of space. But before you get there, you want them to know that there's a counter offer coming later on.

### <a name="case">Make your case

Now you'll write the longest paragraph in the email: your case to justify your counter offer.

Why spend all this time making your case instead of just getting to the point and making your counter offer? There are two main reasons:

First, by making your case _before_ your counter offer, you're reinforcing the fact that you will add significant value to the company in this role. The better your case, the more reasonable your counter offer will seem.

Second, when your recruiter needs additional approval for your counter offer, you need to make it as easy as possible for them to make a strong case to justify the additional salary. So you're giving them a well-written counter offer email that they can circulate along with their request for additional budget. You will make your own case much better than they will.

Don't go overboard here—four or Five reasons that you're a good fit for the role should do it. And make sure each reason includes the skill or experience that you bring to the table _and_ how applying that skill or experience to their team will be valuable to the team and the company.

### <a name="counter">Counter offer

Now we're getting to the good stuff: it's time to counter offer.

Before you counter, it's good to briefly summarize the job offer so there's no confusion or miscommunication because if there has been any miscommunication around your job offer, now is the time to find out.

And then state your counter offer in a firm but neutral way. "I would be more comfortable if we can settle on $115,000." is a good way to phrase your counter offer. It's not combative, but it is firm and makes it easy for the recruiter to simply reply with "Ok, we can do that." if it's within the approved salary range.

### <a name="sign-off">Sign-off

Just as you opened your salary negotiation email with a kind greeting to emphasize that you want to work with your recruiter as a collaborator, you should end the email the same way. You also want to make sure they know that they have the next action—the ball is in their court!

## <a name="quick-tips">Quick tips
	
Here are a few quick tips to help you get the most out of this template.

### One thing at a time

It can be tempting to ask for a bunch of things at once, hoping you get one or two things on your list.

Don't do it!

If you get them a list of things to choose from, they'll choose the cheapest things to give you, and those things will almost certainly not be the things that are most important to you.

### Start with your most important thing

Ask for the thing that is most important to you first. See how much improvement you get there, then move on to the second-most important thing. And then the third.

### Make every "ask" count

You might get up to three "asks", so you'll want to make each one of them count. The best way to do this is by prioritizing the things that are important to you and asking for one at a time.
