	 		<p>“Just hit reply to let us know when you accept the offer and we’ll get started on the paperwork.”</p>		
	 		<p>There it is! You finally got the job offer you’ve been searching for and have spent <em>months</em> interviewing for!</p>
			
	    <h2 class="uppercase">Then you felt that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>You know the one. First, you thought ”I wonder if that’s the absolute best compensation they can offer?” and then “Even if this <em>isn’t</em> their best and final offer, it’s going to be so awkward to ask for more when they clearly expect me to just accept it.”</p>
			
			<p>Still, you play out the scenario in your mind… Ok, so you respond by asking for more money but it feels awkward and uncomfortable. You’re not even sure where to begin and they’ll immediately know you’ve never done this before. Plus, what if they already offered the maximum or, worse, <strong>what if asking for more scares them off and they just take the offer back?</strong><p>
				
			<p><strong>Now you have nothing.</strong> A perfectly good offer just disappeared because they thought you were being greedy.</p>
			
	    <h2 class="uppercase">That isn't how this has to play out</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
	 		<p>What if you could wave a magic wand so you suddenly know exactly what to say and how much to ask for like you’ve done this 100 times? What if you could make such a compelling case that they say, “Wow! What’s it going to take to get this person on our team? It would be a shame to lose them over the comp.”</p>

			<p>...and it’s the culmination of <strong>more than six years of working full-time with over 150 clients and over 1,000 customers</strong> who purchased my flagship courses on salary negotiation to negotiate job offers with phenomenal results.</p>
			
	 		<p><strong>Salary Negotiation Mastery</strong> is a clear, easy-to-follow methodology with all the tools and templates you need to confidently negotiate your next job offer like a seasoned veteran as though I’m sitting there right next to you, telling you exactly what to do and say next.</p>
			
	 		<p>Step-by-step, lesson-by-lesson, I’ll walk you through your salary negotiation giving you the same expert advice that my clients have used to <strong>negotiate over $7.3M more income</strong> in just the first year after working with me without ever losing a single job offer from any tech company.</p>
						
			<p>You’ll know exactly how to negotiate confidently, aggressively advocating for yourself while you collaborate with your recruiter to <strong>find the maximum compensation</strong> available to you. That sinking feeling in your stomach will be replaced with that same feeling you get when you bowl a strike or make a hole-in-one in mini-golf. It’ll feel <em>that</em> good.</p>
