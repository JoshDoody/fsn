## What you'll accomplish in this lesson

You will estimate your market value using a simple three-step process. Before you ask for your raise, it's important to have a specific goal in mind. To set that goal—your target salary—you need to know your market value.

Your market value will give you a baseline that you can adjust to set your target salary in the next lesson.
