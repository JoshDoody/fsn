			<p>Not only did John know he was underpaid, but he could practically see the dollars flying out the window with every passing paycheck. </p>

			<p>Every time he decided to do something about it, he ran into a wall that stopped his momentum:</p>
	
			<p><strong><em>When</em> should he ask?</strong> During his performance review? Some other time? He wasn't sure.</p>

			<p><strong>How should he ask?</strong> Maybe he should get coffee with his boss. Or he could send an email, but what would he say?</p>
	
			<p><strong>How much should he ask for?</strong> He wasn't sure and didn't know how to find out.</p>
	
			<p>And maybe the most intimidating question of all: <strong>What if they say <em>no</em>?</strong> Then what would he do?</p>

					 <p>I’ve used the skills and techniques I learned in this course <strong>again and again over the last four years</strong>. It’s been a huge part of reaching where I am today<strong>—earning 400% more in total compensation</strong> than when I first took the course.</p>

					 <p>When I first started the course, I was earning $75k. <strong>I wanted a raise, but didn’t know where to start.</strong> Josh’s course walked me through a simple process to prepare my case and ask for a raise. Each lesson had specific action items for me to make steady progress, and I got feedback on my work plus great answers to my questions every step of the way.</p>

					 <p>Since taking the course, <strong>I’ve negotiated several compensation increases ranging between $15k and $40k/year at different companies</strong>. At one role, negotiating helped me reach $210k/year in total compensation, which was the top-of-band salary and stock offered. Most recently, I negotiated for an extra $40k in RSUs before accepting an offer with Twitter.</p>

					 <p><strong>Josh's course has helped me practice and get comfortable with salary negotiation and it has really changed my life for the better.</strong> I needed a push and a process, and this course gave me both.</p>

			<p>With the right plan, you can finally able to <em>do something</em> about that too-small paycheck and start making real progress on your financial and professional goals, just like John did.</p>

			<p>The key is that you need to make it <em>super easy</em> for your manager to understand exactly what you deserve and communicate that to the higher-ups in your company.</p>

			<p>The easier you make it for your manager to communicate with the higher-ups, the sooner you'll get the raise you deserve.</p>

			<p><em>But how?!</em></p>

			<p>Based on my experience as a hiring manager, I will show you exactly how to determine what you <em>should</em> be paid so you know what to ask for, and you'll learn how to demonstrate that you deserve a raise based on the valuable work you do.</p>

			<p>I will show you how to make sure you have everything you need to talk to your manager about your raise, ho to schedule that meeting, and how to put everything in writing after you talk so it's <em>easy</em> for your manager to approve your request and pass it along to the higher-ups.</p>

					 <p><strong>I wasn’t sure if the value was there but now that I’ve taken it I can say that EVERYONE should take this course.</strong></p>

					 <p>I wanted to make sure I wasn’t leaving money on the table and that I knew what my manager and company were looking for to give me a raise. This course taught me <em>exactly</em> what I needed to know, and Josh gave great answers to all of my questions about my specific situation.</p>

					 <p>Now I know that preparing for a raise is not difficult or overwhelming with the right guidance and the systemic process I learned in this course.</p>

					  <p><strong>My employer adjusted my comp today to $160k. So $123k to $160k = $37k raise overnight.</strong></p>
					 
				 		<p>So thank you for creating Get Your Next Raise. Obviously I brought the goods in terms of bringing value to my employer. But, when I saw Get Your Next Raise it immediately made sense how it would improve how I communicate that value. All I needed to do was follow the plan, and see what they had to say.</p>
		
				 		<p><strong>It felt particularly empowering to have everything prepared in advance.</strong> I smiled inside when my manager asked me to send her an email with evidence to support my request, and I already had it queued up and ready to go. Also, doing market research was valuable so that I wasn’t just basing my request on what I want or think I’m worth, but that I was actually in line with the same numbers they would see in their own research.</p>

				 		<p>Also, I can’t be certain of this, but I’m pretty confident that the raise they would have given me as part of the normal review cycle is nowhere near what I got by making the request and backing it up.</p>

				 		<p><strong>Get Your Next Raise was easy to follow</strong>, and like I said, it made sense to me. <strong>I spent less than two hours doing the work to prepare everything. That’s an insane return :)</strong></p>

				 		<p>Best of all, I feel valued and respected not just by the individuals within the organization (which I’ve always felt), but also by the organization itself. I’m really looking forward to growing my contributions there... especially now that I have a system for recording and communicating the value I bring.</p>
		
				 		<p>Thank you again.</p>
