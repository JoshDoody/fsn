      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> <strong>Optimize your compensation package</strong> — Your situation is unique. Whether you’re considering a simple compensation package or a complicated one with many moving parts, we will work together to develop and implement the best strategy to ensure that you get optimal results.</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> <strong>Bolster your reputation</strong> — Our approach to negotiating will enhance the company’s perception of you as a savvy, informed business manager who understands the business’s needs and your own market value.</li>
      <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> <strong>Ensure you get the best result</strong> — Many times, we are able to improve your compensation package by 30%, sometimes by 15%, and rarely, your offer is already the best your employer is willing to give, so we have no improvement at all. But no matter what the result is, you can rest easy knowing that you got the maximum compensation for your situation.</li>
