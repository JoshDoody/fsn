				<p>I'm Josh Doody, <strong>a professional salary negotiation coach who helps Senior Software Engineers and Engineering Managers get more job offers and negotiate higher salaries</strong>. On average, the Software Engineers I work with improve their job offers by {{ site.avg_coach_increase_devs }}.</p>

				<p>I didn't negotiate my salary at my first few jobs, but quickly realized I had left a lot of money on the table. <strong>I began negotiating and I doubled my salary in three years.</strong></p>

				<p>Now I use everything I learned from my own experience to help others make tens of thousands more dollars negotiating with <strong>Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Tesla, @WalmartLabs, Zillow, Kimberly-Clark, Bloomberg, Red Hat, Verizon, IBM, Microsoft</strong>, and other companies you've heard of.</p>

				<p>You can learn my strategy and tactics with my book, <a href="/get-started/" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #BF9724;">Fearless Salary Negotiation: A step-by-step guide to getting paid what you're worth.</a></p>
