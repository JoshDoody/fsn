    <p><strong>You're on the clock.</strong> You finally got a job offer from a hospital or group you would like to work with, and they want to know if you're ready to accept it.</p>

		<p>You <em>think</em> you can command a higher salary and a better compensation package, but you just don't know how to negotiate these things in your job offer.</p>
	  <p>How do you counter their job offer? What if you ask for too much? What if you leave money on the table by asking for too little? What if they retract the job offer? <strong>How do you know <em>what to do</em> and <em>if you're doing it correctly</em>?</strong></p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl sans-serif uppercase">Wouldn't it be nice if someone else could just negotiate for you?</h2>

					<p>When I initially received the job offer, I didn’t know what my value was or how to ask for more in a tactful way. I knew that you only get a few chances in your career to negotiate, and that the hospitals and groups are skilled at negotiating against employees. <strong>So I was afraid of being too aggressive, that they would say no, or I that would hurt my relationship with the hospital.</strong></p>

					<p>They initially said that the contract they offered me was standard and nothing changes, but Josh insisted there is no "standard" contract. Turns out Josh was right, there is no “standard” contract, especially in medicine.</p>

					<p><strong>We negotiated a 25% increase in equivalent pay relative to what I would’ve gotten with the group’s “standard” contract.</strong> Josh is excellent at training you in how to present yourself in negotiations so everyone feels like they’re on the same team while you’re still standing up for yourself.</p>

					<p>I 100% recommend working with Josh to negotiate your contract. I learned that there is a tactful and kind way to explore the boundaries of a possible contract with the hospital or group, and <strong>not only did I negotiate for higher pay and more non-monetary benefits in my department, but I also have a higher quality of life, more time, and more resources than I would have without Josh's help</strong>.</p>

      <p>Depending upon the complexity of the situation and your needs, the strategy fee is between $3,000 and $6,000. The strategy fee is for all aspects of your salary negotiation. It ensures that I can build and execute the best possible strategy for each and every client.</p>

      <p>The result fee is due only when we improve your job offer, and is 10% of the improvement to your first-year compensation that we negotiate.</p>

			 <p>The result fee is to ensure that our incentives are aligned throughout our engagement and to help us both share directly in the results. Sometimes, a company is very flexible and will significantly improve their offer through negotiation. Sometimes they are inflexible and their first offer is also their best offer. We cannot know which case applies to your offer until we negotiate, and the result fee enables us to work together knowing that we will share in the result.</p>

						<p>Physicians at the beginning of their careers may need assistance in negotiating, as many of us have no experience with negotiating. Residency and fellowship frequently have set salaries with set benefits, and there is often absolutely nothing we can negotiate. So because our first job offer maybe be <em>siginficantly</em> higher than our residency or fellowship pay, <strong>many of us just take the initial offer, accidentally undervaluing ourselves</strong> (like I did at the job I am leaving).</p>

						<p>With my most recent job offer, <strong>I decided to negotiate my contract to get what I actually wanted, rather than immediately accepting the initial offer</strong>.</p>

						<p>Working with Josh was great because of the confidence it gave me in the negotiation process to ask for what I wanted and not second-guess myself.</p>

						<p><strong>I negotiated for less weekend call—25 call shifts in my initial offer down to 15 call shifts—which gives me more free time with my baby and family, and a better work-life balance.</strong></p>
