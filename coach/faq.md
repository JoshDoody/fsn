- question: "I'm not earning $400k+ per year—can I still work with you?"
  answer: "Yes. I built this business to help people at all stages of their career. The clients who get the best results from Salary Negotiation Coaching are High Earners, but lots of other clients have gotten stellar results and I have other offerings that might be a better fit for you.  The best thing to do is to [contact me](/contact/) so I can learn more about your situation and recommend the best next steps for you and your situation."
- question: "When is the best time to reach out about Salary Negotiation Coaching?"
  answer: "The absolute best time for us to talk about working together is when you are entering the offer stage and one more more companies have indicated that an offer may be coming soon.  But any time during your job search process—if you're just starting your search, or if you already have an offer in hand—is a good time for us to talk about whether Salary Negotiation Coaching could be right for you."
- question: "How do we get started?"
  answer: "Once we have talked about your situation and I have determined the best next steps for you, I will send you a _Letter of Engagement_ to review and sign. Once you sign the _Letter of Engagement_, then we will begin working together."
- question: "When is payment due?"
  answer: "The fee for your Salary Negotiation Coaching engagement will be due after our work is complete.  Please see the “[Fee Payment](#payment)” section below for an in-depth explanation of the Negotiation Fee, how it is paid, and when it is paid."
- question: "What’s it like to work with you for Salary Negotiation Coaching? How will we communicate?"
  answer: "Every engagement is different and you will have a lot of input into how we work together.  Most engagements are a mix of check-in calls, mock negotiations, email communications, collaborating on Google Docs (like email drafts), and other touch-points as well depending on what you prefer.  Typically, I communicate with clients on a phone call for our strategy call (about an hour), and then we communicate through email and collaborate using Google Drive for much of our work after that. Some clients prefer to communicate exclusively through text message. Some prefer email. Some clients like to jump on a call occasionally.  At the end of the day, we’ll work together in a way that is best for you and that allows us to get you the best possible result."
- question: "What’s your availability during negotiations?"
  answer: "I tend to work US East Coast business hours (9 to 5) on business days, which has always worked well for my clients. For negotiation emergencies, I may work outside of those hours, but these sorts of emergencies are very rare since most companies also work US business hours."
- question: "How does it work?"
  answer: "I’ll start by setting up a Google Drive folder, which we’ll use to collaborate throughout your negotiation(s). I’ll share some documents with you and get your input so that we get off to a smooth start.  Then we’ll schedule our strategy call where I’ll learn more about your situation, do a deep dive into your opportunities, and develop a strategy for your situation.  Then we’ll negotiate! This typically starts with determining your risk tolerance and the appropriate level of aggression for your specific situation. From there, we can determine the right counter offer—which component of the offer we’ll focus on first, and how much we’ll counter. Then I’ll write your counter offer and collaborate with you to polish it up before we send it. Once we’ve countered, we’ll focus on preparing for the next stages of your negotiation including scripting your conversations with the recruiter, rehearsing your scripts, and whatever else we need to make sure you’re fully prepared for the final stages of your negotiation.  Each negotiation is different because each situation, candidate, opportunity, and company is different. I’ll usually be able to walk you through your strategy at the end of our strategy call.  Once we’ve finished negotiating, you’ll choose the opportunity that’s best for you and I’m happy to consult with you about that decision as well."
- question: "How much does it cost?"
  answer: "The Negotiation Fee has two components—Strategy and Improvement—and is not paid until _after_ our work is complete.  The Strategy Component is $4,000. The Improvement Component is 10% of the improvement we negotiate in your first year’s compensation.   _Strategy Component_  The Strategy Component covers all aspects of your salary negotiation. It ensures that I can provide the best quality strategy for every client.  Some of the strategic considerations for a typical engagement are:  - Which dimension(s) to focus on during the negotiation - How aggressive to be - How to make the best case for higher compensation - Managing multiple offers and negotiations simultaneously - Managing multiple timelines  _Improvement Component_  The Improvement Component is due only when we improve your job offer, and is 10% of the improvement to your first-year compensation that we negotiate.  The Improvement Component is to ensure that our incentives are consistently aligned. Sometimes, a company is very flexible and will significantly improve their offer through negotiation. Sometimes they are inflexible and their first offer is also their best offer. We cannot know which case applies to your offer until we negotiate, and the Improvement Component enables us to work together knowing that we will share in the result.  You keep 90% of the negotiated first-year compensation improvement, and I collect the remaining 10%.  You keep 100% of the negotiated improvement after the first year.  If the company does not budge on their offer when we negotiate, there is no Improvement Component."
- question: "# What if we don't have an initial offer to use as the baseline for the Improvement Component?"
  answer: "Very, very rarely, a company will insist that you essentially design your own comp package in consultation with them. This may happen for select executive or leadership roles in some cases.   If our negotiation involves creating a comp package rather than negotiating from their initial offer, then the Improvement Component will be 2% of the Year 1 total compensation that we negotiate."
- question: "Besides the Negotiation Fee, are there any other fees for Salary Negotiation Coaching?"
  answer: "No. There are no additional fees beyond the Negotiation Fee."
- question: "How does equity that vests over multiple years affect the Improvement Component?"
  answer: "The equity portion of the Improvement Component will only take into account the equity that vests for the first year. It’s probably easiest to explain this with a simple example.  If we were to negotiate an additional $100,000 in total equity, and that equity vests equally over four years (25% per year), then we would only consider 25% of that $100,000 improvement in equity in the Improvement Component calculation.  So the Improvement Component for the equity portion of the Negotiation Fee would be calculated as follows:  The equity vesting for the first year would be $25,000 (25% of the additional $100,000 in equity we negotiated), and the Improvement Component for the equity would be 10% of $25,000, or $2,500."
- question: "Does a sign-on bonus affect the Improvement Component?"
  answer: "Yes, if it is part of your first-year compensation. If your offer does not include a sign-on bonus and we negotiate for one, then that will affect the Improvement Component. If your offer includes a sign-on bonus and we improve it, then that would also affect the Improvement Component. Some offers might include sign-on bonuses over multiple years, and we will only include first-year sign-on bonuses in our Improvement Component calculation."
- question: "Is there a cap on the Improvement Component?"
  answer: "There is no cap on the Improvement Component.  The Improvement Component, and specifically the un-capped Improvement Component, is a crucial aspect of my offering that guarantees that our incentives are perfectly aligned throughout our work together. When the Improvement Component gets large, that means your improvement was large as well, so we both have something to aim for and to celebrate."
- question: "What if I have multiple job offers?"
  answer: "All of your current negotiations are covered under your Strategy Component. We’ll negotiate all of your offers for this cycle and then you’ll choose the offer that is most appealing to you. Once you’ve chosen that offer, we’ll calculate your Improvement Component based on the offer you chose (ignoring the other offers).  If you have three offers in hand and two more come in while we’re negotiating, we’ll negotiate all five of those offers if needed.  If you have 10 offers in hand and we negotiate one for your dream job, and you decide not to negotiate the others, then we’ll just negotiate that one offer.  If we negotiate all of your current offers and you don’t choose one, then we’ll pause until you find one worthy of negotiating and try again.  Basically, we’ll negotiate your offers until you find one that works for you."
- question: "Why is Salary Negotiation Coaching worth the cost?"
  answer: "There are two main benefits to Salary Negotiation Coaching. The first benefit is that you will know for sure that you have negotiated the best possible compensation package for your new job. For most of my clients, even a 2–3% increase in their job offer more than covers the cost of salary negotiation coaching, and the average result is more than a 15% improvement in first-year compensation (that’s an average 7% increase in salary, almost 60% more equity, and more than 25% improvement in sign-on bonus).  Of course, these results are on a scale from “no flexibility” to “way more than that”, but those are the averages.  The second main benefit is that you will learn how to negotiate your job offers from now on throughout your career. You’ll learn a valuable skill that you can use to negotiate your own offers, or to help your friends and family negotiate their offers as well. We will collaborate throughout your salary negotiation so that you know exactly what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and you’ll have input every step of the way."
- question: "My spouse/partner/friends say your fee is too high and I should just do it myself. What do you say to that?"
  answer: "If we don’t work together to negotiate your offer, please please please make sure you negotiate it yourself! Some type of negotiation is better than no negotiation.  But the best type of negotiation is working with a professional who does this for a living—that’s me! For most of my clients, the Strategy Component is 1–2% of their total compensation _at most_, which means my fee is a relatively small investment with tremendous upside. And the Improvement Component immediately returns 10x that investment in Year 1.  It’s difficult to quantify how much you could be leaving on the table when you don’t negotiate optimally, but it’s probably several times my fee.   Investing a tiny fraction of your total compensation to work with a professional salary negotiator and avoid leaving multiples of my fee on the table seems like a good investment, but that’s ultimately for you to decide."
- question: "Is your fee negotiable?"
  answer: "My fee is not negotiable. Salary Negotiation Coaching isn’t for everyone and that’s ok!"
- question: "When is payment due?"
  answer: "Payment is not due until _after_ our work together is complete.  Once we have completed our work together, I will calculate the Improvement Component and add that to the Strategy Component to determine the final Negotiation Fee. Then I'll send an invoice for the final Negotiation Fee.  Most clients pay the Negotiation Fee right away, while some wait until they begin their new job. You and I will work together to figure out the timing that works best for you.  Please see the “[Cost](#cost)” section of this document for an in-depth explanation of the fee structure for Salary Negotiation Coaching."
- question: "What are my payment options?"
  answer: "The payment options are credit card, ACH (bank transfer) or paper check.  ACH or paper check are preferred, but credit card is also an option if the others aren't feasible."
- question: "Can you guarantee results?"
  answer: "Results cannot be guaranteed. Although I have extensive experience negotiating with all of the big tech companies and many others, there is no way to know what is possible without negotiating.  Sometimes, a company will have substantial flexibility and will drastically improve their offer for the right candidate. Sometimes a company will have no flexibility and won’t budge regardless of how strong the candidate is.  This variability is why there is an Improvement Component: If the company does not budge on their offer when we negotiate, I don’t collect any Improvement Component. If the company does improve their offer, you keep 90% of the first year’s improvement (and 100% of the improvements after that), and I keep 10%."
- question: "How often do your clients improve their job offers?"
  answer: "About 90% of the time my clients’ offers are improved.  That means that about 10% of the time the company’s initial offer was their best and final offer, which we confirmed by employing the best possible strategy to negotiate that offer."
- question: "What’s the Return on Investment on Salary Negotiation Coaching?"
  answer: "That depends on many factors, and I think of Return on Investment in two ways:  Quantitative—Job offers sometimes don’t change at all or improve by only a few thousand dollars more than what was offered, and sometimes the value of negotiating can be more than a million dollars. For most offers, a one-percent improvement means a positive Return on Investment for Salary Negotiation Coaching, and the average total compensation improvement is more than 15%.  Qualitative—Aside from negotiating the best possible version of your compensation package, I will teach you _how_ to negotiate your job offers so that you have this skill in your arsenal for the rest of your career. And you can use this skill to help friends and family negotiate their offers as well."
- question: "Do you have a referral program?"
  answer: "Yes! I prefer to work with referred clients whenever possible."
- question: "How does your referral program work?"
  answer: "My [referral program](/coach/referral/) is pretty simple and straightforward: If you recommend someone to me and they decide to work with me, I'll give you $500.  But here's the catch: I need the person you referred to let me know that you're the one who sent them my way.  To make sure you get your bonus, the best thing to do is ask the person you're referring to drop your name when they're filling out the application form. There's a question on there that asks, \"How did you hear about me?\" - that's the perfect place for them to mention your name. That way, I'll know for sure that you referred them, and I can send that bonus your way!\"  If your questions aren’t answered here, [contact me](/contact/) any time and I’m happy to answer other questions you might have."

### When is the best time to reach out about Salary Negotiation Coaching?

The absolute best time for us to talk about working together is when you are entering the offer stage and one more more companies have indicated that an offer may be coming soon.

But any time during your job search process—if you're just starting your search, or if you already have an offer in hand—is a good time for us to talk about whether Salary Negotiation Coaching could be right for you.

### How do we get started?

Once we have talked about your situation and I have determined the best next steps for you, I will send you a _Letter of Engagement_ to review and sign. Once you sign the _Letter of Engagement_, then we will begin working together.

### When is payment due?

The fee for your Salary Negotiation Coaching engagement will be due after our work is complete.

Please see the “[Fee Payment](#payment)” section below for an in-depth explanation of the Negotiation Fee, how it is paid, and when it is paid.

### What’s it like to work with you for Salary Negotiation Coaching? How will we communicate?

Every engagement is different and you will have a lot of input into how we work together.

Most engagements are a mix of check-in calls, mock negotiations, email communications, collaborating on Google Docs (like email drafts), and other touch-points as well depending on what you prefer.

Typically, I communicate with clients on a phone call for our strategy call (about an hour), and then we communicate through email and collaborate using Google Drive for much of our work after that.

“**Josh helped me negotiate with Alphabet to get an additional $160k in annual compensation.**

Bringing Josh on made a huge difference for me — no way I would have ended up with that number without his help. **Whether you're a mid-level engineer or an executive — to me it's a no brainer to work with Josh.**” -Taylor, Executive at Alphabet

### How much does it cost?

The Negotiation Fee has two components—Strategy and Improvement—and is not paid until _after_ our work is complete.

The Strategy Component is $4,000. The Improvement Component is 10% of the improvement we negotiate in your first year’s compensation. 

_Strategy Component_

The Strategy Component covers all aspects of your salary negotiation. It ensures that I can provide the best quality strategy for every client.

Some of the strategic considerations for a typical engagement are:

- Which dimension(s) to focus on during the negotiation
- How aggressive to be
- How to make the best case for higher compensation
- Managing multiple offers and negotiations simultaneously
- Managing multiple timelines

_Improvement Component_

The Improvement Component is due only when we improve your job offer, and is 10% of the improvement to your first-year compensation that we negotiate.

The Improvement Component is to ensure that our incentives are consistently aligned. Sometimes, a company is very flexible and will significantly improve their offer through negotiation. Sometimes they are inflexible and their first offer is also their best offer. We cannot know which case applies to your offer until we negotiate, and the Improvement Component enables us to work together knowing that we will share in the result.

You keep 90% of the negotiated first-year compensation improvement, and I collect the remaining 10%.

You keep 100% of the negotiated improvement after the first year.

If the company does not budge on their offer when we negotiate, there is no Improvement Component.

#### What if we don't have an initial offer to use as the baseline for the Improvement Component?

Very, very rarely, a company will insist that you essentially design your own comp package in consultation with them. This may happen for select executive or leadership roles in some cases. 

If our negotiation involves creating a comp package rather than negotiating from their initial offer, then the Improvement Component will be 2% of the Year 1 total compensation that we negotiate.

### Besides the Negotiation Fee, are there any other fees for Salary Negotiation Coaching?

No. There are no additional fees beyond the Negotiation Fee.

### How does equity that vests over multiple years affect the Improvement Component?

The equity portion of the Improvement Component will only take into account the equity that vests for the first year. It’s probably easiest to explain this with a simple example.

If we were to negotiate an additional $100,000 in total equity, and that equity vests equally over four years (25% per year), then we would only consider 25% of that $100,000 improvement in equity in the Improvement Component calculation.

So the Improvement Component for the equity portion of the Negotiation Fee would be calculated as follows:

The equity vesting for the first year would be $25,000 (25% of the additional $100,000 in equity we negotiated), and the Improvement Component for the equity would be 10% of $25,000, or $2,500.

### Does a sign-on bonus affect the Improvement Component?

Yes, if it is part of your first-year compensation. 

If your offer does not include a sign-on bonus and we negotiate for one, then that will affect the Improvement Component. If your offer includes a sign-on bonus and we improve it, then that would also affect the Improvement Component. 

Some offers might include sign-on bonuses over multiple years, and we will only include first-year sign-on bonuses in our Improvement Component calculation.

### Is there a cap on the Improvement Component?

There is no cap on the Improvement Component.

The Improvement Component, and specifically the un-capped Improvement Component, is a crucial aspect of my offering that guarantees that our incentives are perfectly aligned throughout our work together. When the Improvement Component gets large, that means your improvement was large as well, so we both have something to aim for and to celebrate.

### What if I have multiple job offers?

All of your current negotiations are covered under your Strategy Component. We’ll negotiate all of your offers for this cycle and then you’ll choose the offer that is most appealing to you. Once you’ve chosen that offer, we’ll calculate your Improvement Component based on the offer you chose (ignoring the other offers).

If you have three offers in hand and two more come in while we’re negotiating, we’ll negotiate all five of those offers if needed.

If you have 10 offers in hand and we negotiate one for your dream job, and you decide not to negotiate the others, then we’ll just negotiate that one offer.

If we negotiate all of your current offers and you don’t choose one, then we’ll pause until you find one worthy of negotiating and try again.

You’ll learn a valuable skill that you can use to negotiate your own offers, or to help your friends and family negotiate their offers as well. We will collaborate throughout your salary negotiation so that you know exactly what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and you’ll have input every step of the way.

### Is your fee negotiable?

My fee is not negotiable. Salary Negotiation Coaching isn’t for everyone and that’s ok!

## <a name="payment">Fee Payment

### When is payment due?

Payment is not due until _after_ our work together is complete.

Once we have completed our work together, I will calculate the Improvement Component and add that to the Strategy Component to determine the final Negotiation Fee. Then I'll send an invoice for the final Negotiation Fee.

Most clients pay the Negotiation Fee right away, while some wait until they begin their new job. You and I will work together to figure out the timing that works best for you.

About 90% of the time my clients’ offers are improved.

That means that about 10% of the time the company’s initial offer was their best and final offer, which we confirmed by employing the best possible strategy to negotiate that offer.

### What’s the Return on Investment on Salary Negotiation Coaching?

That depends on many factors, and I think of Return on Investment in two ways:

Quantitative—Job offers sometimes don’t change at all or improve by only a few thousand dollars more than what was offered, and sometimes the value of negotiating can be more than a million dollars. For most offers, a one-percent improvement means a positive Return on Investment for Salary Negotiation Coaching, and the average total compensation improvement is more than 15%.
