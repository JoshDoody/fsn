    <p><strong>You're on the clock.</strong> You finally got a job offer from a company you would like to work with, and they want to know if you're ready to accept it.</p>

		<p>You <em>think</em> you can command a higher salary and a better compensation package, but you just don't know how to negotiate these things in your job offer.</p>
	  <p>How do you counter their job offer? What if you ask for too much? What if you leave money on the table by asking for too little? What if they retract the job offer? <strong>How do you know <em>what to do</em> and <em>if you're doing it correctly</em>?</strong></p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl sans-serif uppercase">Wouldn't it be nice if someone else could just negotiate for you?</h2>

			<p>Your Negotiation Fee will not be paid until <em>after</em> we complete our work, and I have a 100% satisfaction money back guarantee.</p>

      <p>Depending upon the complexity of the situation and your needs, the Strategy Component is between $3,000 and $6,000. The Strategy Component is for all aspects of your salary negotiation. It ensures that I can build and execute the best possible strategy for each and every client.</p>

      <p>The Result Component is due only when we improve your job offer, and is 10% of the improvement to your first-year compensation that we negotiate.</p>

			 <p>The Result Component is to ensure that our incentives are consistently aligned. Sometimes, a company is very flexible and will significantly improve their offer through negotiation. Sometimes they are inflexible and their first offer is also their best offer. We cannot know which case applies to your offer until we negotiate, and the Result Component enables us to work together knowing that we will share in the result.</p>

    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
		<p>Once you sign and return your Letter of Engagement, we'll get started by scheduling your strategy call. During this call, we will discuss your specific situation in detail and lay out our strategy for negotiating your offer.</p>

		<p>I'll negotiate your salary behind the scenes, consulting with you every step of the way to provide the best strategy to negotiate the best version of your job offer.</p>

		<p>Once we conclude our engagement, we will calculate the Result Component—10% of the improvement in your first-year compensation—and arrange payment for the Negotiation Fee.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl sans-serif uppercase">Jonathan turned disappointing offers from Amazon and Tesla into an additional $80,000 compensation at Tesla</h2>
    <hr class="my-8 w-16">

		<p>Jonathan was a Senior Software Engineer with lots of experience working for big-time tech companies. He was ready for a change, so he applied for Senior Engineering roles at Amazon and Tesla. He quickly got two job offers, but they were both very disappointing.</p>

		<p>He reached out and asked if I could help.</p>

		<p>Since the offers were both disappointing, I recommended that we get Amazon and Tesla to improve the offers before we began negotiating. If they would improve the offers from 'disappointing' to 'negotiable', then we could go to work.</p>

		<p>After a few days, both companies came back to Jonathan with significantly better offers. Now we had room to work!</p>

		<h3 class="text-black sans-serif uppercase text-2xl mb-5">Negotiating total compensation with base salary and RSUs in play</h3>

		<p>One tricky aspect of each offer was that they were very heavily focused on RSUs—Restricted Stock Units—which is common for public tech companies. Amazon caps base salary for most employees, and they offer RSUs as their primary negotiation lever once that base salary cap is reached.</p>

		<p>RSUs can potentially be very valuable, but it's difficult to impute a present value on them in order to compare the value of the RSUs to, say, base salary or a signing bonus.</p>

		<p>Through a careful analysis of the job offer and current market conditions, I was able to estimate the present value of the RSUs and help Jonathan negotiate on the two dimensions he cared most about: his base salary and RSUs.</p>

		<h3 class="text-black sans-serif uppercase text-2xl mb-5">Choosing between two good options</h3>

		<p>We were able to significantly improve both of Jonathan's job offers from Amazon and Tesla so that he had a difficult decision to make.</p>

		<p>With the hard work of negotiating behind us, we turned our focus to comparing the two opportunities on several dimensions to help Jonathan determine which opportunity was right for him.</p>

		<p>In the end, he chose Tesla for the work environment, greater opportunity to work on new technology and manage a team, and better compensation.</p>

		<p>By investing in salary negotiation coaching, Jonathan was able to improve his first-year compensation by $80,000.</p>

		<p>Here's what Jonathan had to say about the experience of working together:</p>

	        <p><strong>I would highly recommend Josh as a salary negotiation coach because has the knowledge and experience of what it takes to maximize your salary and total compensation.</strong></p>

					<p>I was expecting job offers from <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Tesla</strong>, and I wanted to be confident I got the best offer from each company so I could make the right decision. <strong>I considered just handling it myself, but decided I would rather work with an experienced coach and expert with whom I could discuss all aspects of the positions and corresponding offers.</strong></p>

					<p>What a great decision!</p>

					<p><strong>Approachable, knowledgeable, available</strong></p>

					<p>Josh is very approachable and knowledgeable about the entire process and was able to provide possible next steps that were very accurate. <strong>He made himself available for calls and was very quick responding to emails with thorough, specific guidance on what to write or say at each stage in the negotiations.</strong> He was there to answer even the smallest of questions.</p>

					<p>Josh took time to research specific questions related to both positions and the intricacies of the salary and total compensation discussions for both companies. The offers I got were <em>very</em> different offers, and he took the time to break them down into components so we could negotiate effectively and do an apples-to-apples comparison so I could make the best decision.</p>

					<p><strong>A great investment</strong></p>

					<p>I would highly recommend Josh as a salary negotiation coach because has the knowledge and experience of what it takes to maximize your salary and total compensation. He is also highly approachable and made himself available on very short notice.</p>

					<p>Josh added value by making me confident when performing salary negotiations and showing me how to take the right steps in the process. He was professional and honest during the entire process.</p>

					<p>This was a great investment.</p>
