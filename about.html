      <p class="serif">I'm a Salary Negotiation Coach who helps Senior Software Engineers and Engineering Managers negotiate job offers with big tech companies. I have two primary goals for every client I work with: Maximize the value of your job offer without leaving anything on the table, and teach you exactly how to do what I do.</p>
			
      <p class="serif">On average, Software Engineers and Engineering Managers improve their first-year compensation by {{ site.avg_coach_increase_devs }} with my help.</p>
			
      <p class="serif">I love what I do!</p>

      <h3 class="sans-serif uppercase text-2xl mb-5">My background</h3>

      <p class="serif">I studied Computer & Electrical Engineering at the University of Florida, and later retuned to earn my MBA. I began my career as an electrical engineer before changing directions to work as a business analyst and project manager for s small software company in the Talent Management industry.</p>
			
      <p class="serif">I spent about 10 years consulting with companies on how to use software to do performance reviews, set and align goals, and plan compensation for their organizations. Once I understood how companies pay their employees, I began negotiating my own salary and eventually helping friends and family negotiate their salaries.</p>
			
			 <p class="serif">I eventually wrote <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> to share my methodology with as many people as possible. And I've spent the past several years coaching Senior Software Engineers and Engineering Managers through negotiations with big tech companies to make sure they're paid what they're worth.</p>

      <h2 class="sans-serif uppercase text-3xl mb-10">About Fearless Salary Negotiation</h2>

      <p class="serif"><em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> is my way of helping others understand their value and use collaborative strategies and tactics to finally get paid what theyâ€™re worth.</p>
			
      <p class="serif ">It began as a book that quickly became a #1 Best Seller on Amazon. As I coached software developers and other professionals through their salary negotiations, I continued building this site to share everything I know about salary negotiation so others can benefit as well.</p>
			
      <p class="serif"><em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> is now recognized as a go-to resource by the media and customers alike. The book and courses have been used by thousands of people to earn millions of dollars that they otherwise would have left on the table.</p>
