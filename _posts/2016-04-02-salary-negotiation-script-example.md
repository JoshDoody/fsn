**Once you've responded to your job offer with a counter offer, the company will probably respond with something between your job offer and your counteroffer.** That's your negotiation window. Your goal is to maximize your salary within that window.

Here's a salary negotiation counteroffer calculator you can use to determine your counter offer: [Salary negotiation script and counter offer calculator](/salary-negotiation-script/)

## Salary negotiation script example from a real negotiation

In this example the company has made _an offer of **$50,000**_, and _you have countered at **$56,000**_. Your _negotiation window is now **$50,000**–**$56,000**_. This sample salary negotiation script is your plan for hashing out the final details of your compensation package in the Final Discussion by _first_ maximizing your base salary and _then_ negotiating for additional benefits.

(Your [Minimum Acceptable Salary](/minimum-acceptable-salary/) is the underlined row.)

### <u>$56,000</u> (Counter)

*   **$55,000** - Sounds good, when do I start?
*   **$54,000** - $55,000 and I'm on board! - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office
*   **$53,000** - $54,000 and I'm on board! - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office
*   <u>**$52,000** - $54,000 and I'm on board! - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office</u>
*   **$51,000** - I can't accept less than $52,000.

### <u>$50,000</u> (Offer)

## How to use this script

The company will discuss your counter internally and determine how much they can pay you. Then you will often have a quick phone call with the recruiter or hiring manager to determine your final salary and other benefits.

When the company responds to your counter, _use this script to maximize your starting salary and benefits_. For each step, if they accept your proposal, then you're finished. If they don't accept your proposal, go to the next step.

1.  **Use the first statement as your first response.** In this example, if the company comes back with $55,000, you'll say, "Sounds good, when do I start?" If the company comes back with $54,000, you'll say, "$55,000 and I'm on board!"
2.  **If they do not accept your first response, take the current salary as your base and request your highest-priority benefit.** In this example, if the company comes back with $53,000, then you say "If you can do $54,000, I'm on board!"

    If they stick with $53,000, then you would say, "I understand the best you can do is $53,000 and you can't come up to $54,000. If you can do $53,000 and offer an extra week of paid vacation each year, then I'm on board."

3.  **If they do not accept your highest-priority benefit, then you move on to your second-priority benefit.** To continue our example, you would say, "We're at $53,000 and you're unable to offer an extra week of paid vacation. But if you can allow me to work remotely from home two days a week, I'm on board!"
4.  **If they do not accept your second-priority benefit, you move on to your third-priority benefit.**

Regardless of whether they accept your response, then you're finished. You have maximized your base salary and maximized your benefits as well.

## This is a real salary negotiation script I used during a salary negotiation

I've changed the names and numbers, but this salary negotiation script example is based on a real script I used to negotiate starting salary.

Here are the steps I took after receiving a verbal job offer from the hiring manager:

1.  Asked for time to consider the offer using [this email template](/respond-to-job-offer-email/)
2.  [Calculated my counter offer](/salary-negotiation-script/).
3.  Drafted my response using this [salary negotiation email template](/salary-negotiation-email-sample/).
4.  Sent the draft email to a friend to get his feedback.
5.  Edited the draft based on my friend's feedback.
6.  Sent my counter offer email to the recruiter I had been working with.
7.  Planned my salary negotiation script just like you see on this page.
8.  Had the final discussion with the recruiter where I used the script to negotiate just like you see on this page.
9.  Set my start date.
10.  Started a great new job.
