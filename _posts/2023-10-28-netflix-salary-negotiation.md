Netflix is unusual in many ways among big tech companies. One of the differences that really sets it apart is that its job offers are pretty much one-dimensional: cash. They don't offer RSUs or target bonuses, but they do offer stock options as a benefit (5% of base pay) and they occasionally offer [sign-on bonuses](/sign-on-bonus-overview/). Netflix employees also have the ability to buy stock options for a very good price through their Stock Option Program.

But what about _negotiating_ Netflix offers? Aren't they famous for _not_ negotiating them?

For a long time, it was true that Netflix did not negotiate their offers except in very unique circumstances. But with increasing market competition and a closer focus on operating expenses and payroll costs, they have slowly begun to migrate over to a more traditional organizational structure and compensation philosophy.

That means that if you do manage to get a Netflix offer, there are tactful ways to negotiate that could result in a significantly-improved offer.

## What a typical Netflix job offer package looks like

Once you actually get through the Netflix interview gauntlet, you may receive a job offer. Let's look at an example to see what you can expect.

Netflix's offers are a little unusual relative to other big tech job offers because they are almost exclusively cash-based and rarely include equity:

 - Base salary
 - Sign-on
 - Stock options
 - Relocation Benefits
 - ~Target bonus~
 - ~New-Hire Equity~

So that leaves a pretty straight-forward compensation package: base salary with a very small possibility of a sign-on bonus and 5% of base salary in stock options. They also offer very generous relocation benefits if you need to move in order to work at Netflix.

Let's walk through each component of a Netflix job offer 

### Base Salary

As with most job offers, this is the stable, predictable component that you can use to pay your mortgage or car payment. 

Netflix's base salary offers tend to be substantially higher than other firms because the base salary represents almost all of their overall compensation packages. If you're wondering whether the salary you're offered is competitive, [blind](https://www.teamblind.com) and [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi) are good places to start.

#### How flexible is Netflix on Base Salary?

There are several factors here that make this a moving target.

##### Seniority

In general, the more junior the role, the firmer the initial offer. The more senior the role, the more room to negotiate there might be.

For example, a Junior Engineer (E3) offer might be totally inflexible. On the other hand, a Principle Engineer (E7) offer might have substantial flexibility.

Although they have softened their stance on job offer negotiation, they are still primarily focused on hiring the best talent available, and the most talented people are often the most experience _and_ the most in-demand. That means they sometimes have to fight to persuade the most talented people to join their team, and that can mean more flexibility in a negotiation.

##### Specialty

Even within levels, there can be significant variation in base salary flexibility. For example, User Interface Engineers and Machine Learning Engineers at the same level may have significantly different pay and negotiating leverage.

This is because some specialties are more in-demand and there are fewer people available with those skillsets.

### Sign-on bonus

Netflix doesn't typically offer sign-on bonuses, but they _are_ available in some cases.

</blockquote>

#### How flexible is Netflix on Sign-on bonus?

There are several factors here that make this a moving target. In general, they don't offer sign-on bonuses. When they do, it's usually for a very experienced person with expertise in a niche that is particularly useful to the company.

In those cases, they might be flexible in going from "no sign-on" to "some sign-on". Industry-standard sign-on bonuses are anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 depending on the role.

### Stock options

Netflix employees receive a stock options benefit equal to 5% of their base salary. This likely isn't negotiable as it's a one-size-fits-all type of benefit that everyone gets.

### Relocation Benefits

Netflix has a team (the Talent Mobility team) dedicated to helping relocate people who need to move for their new role. This benefit can be _very_ generous and they work hard to make sure that relocation isn't a barrier or significant distraction as you're gearing up for your new Netflix role.

#### How flexible is Netflix on Relocation Benefits?

This is a difficult question to answer because they are so generous. While this is likely not "negotiable", it is flexible enough to take care of what you need when you relocate. Make sure you talk in depth with the Netflix team about _any_ costs you might incur when making your move so they can be generous with this benefit.

### Target Bonus

Netflix doesn't offer target bonuses.

### New-Hire Equity (RSUs)

Netflix doesn't offer new-hire equity.

## How to approach your Netflix salary negotiation

The salary negotiation with Netflix will begin earlier than you might expect.

### Before you get a job offer

Your Netflix recruiter might ask for your salary history, or at least your *current* salary if it's legal where they are. Do not tell them your current salary. If you do, your job offer may only be slightly above your current salary *and* it will be challenging to negotiate a substantial increase once they make your job offer.

They will also usually ask for your salary expectations. That request will sound something like this:

> So what were you hoping for in terms of compensation if you come aboard here at Netflix?

Do not tell them your salary expectations because you will essentially be guessing what they might pay someone with your skillset and experience to do the job they need done.

While *they* might have a good idea of the value of that job to Netflix's business, *you* would only be guessing. You will practically always guess wrong and cost yourself money later on. So just don't guess.

Netflix will hold on tight to these numbers and it can be very, very challenging to get them to move once they know what they are aiming for. So avoid sharing that information if at all possible.

They may also ask you to tell them about any competing offers you have because they "need more data". I generally recommend that my clients confirm that they have one or more competing offers while being vague about the details of those offers. It's ok to mention that other big tech companies are interested, but sharing the specific companies or details of the offers could work against you in the early stages of the negotiation.

### Once you receive your job offer from Netflix

Because of Netflix' unusually cash-focused compensation structure, you should focus on base salary. How much additional salary to ask for is dependent on how senior your role is and how specialized your skillset is. 

In general, the more senior you are, the more aggressive you should be, and the more specialized your skillset is, the more aggressive you should be.

The reason for this rule of thumb is that your level of aggression will usually be based on how badly they need you to do this particular job for them. The more senior and specialized you are, the more they're going to need you, specifically, to do the job they've offered you. That gives you more leighway to negotiate.

## The Netflix Employee Stock Option Program

One unusual benefit that Netflix offers is the Employee Stock Option Program. It can be a _very_ valuable benefit to Netflix employees, so it's worth taking some time to walk through it.

Most big tech companies offer some sort of Employee Stock Purchase Program, which enables employees to buy shares of stock (RSUs) at a discount. Netflix's Employee Stock Option Program is different because they offer stock options with a 10-year exercise window—this is a _very_ generous exercise window—and those options stay with you if you leave Netflix.

Netflix automatically gives employees stock options equivalent to 5% of their base salary _and_ you can choose to be paid your base salary or substitute base salary for equivalent stock options, purchased at 40% of the current Netflix stock trading price. ("Current" meaning the Netflix stock price at the close of the first trading day of the month.)

As an example, if you were making $100,000 a year base salary at Netflix...

- You would automatically receive $5,000 (5% of $100,000) in stock options per year. One twelfth of your options would be purchased each month on Grant Day. That $5,000 would be used to buy options at 40% of the Netflix stock price on grant day, and those options' strike price would be the price on Grant Day when they were purchased.
- You could _also_ choose to substitute any amount of your base salary to buy stock options on Grant Day. Each year, you decide what proportion of your base salary you will allocate for the Employee Stock Option Program for that year. So if you decided to "spend" 10% of your base salary to buy Netflix stock options, then you would get $10,000 of stock options, 1/12 purchased monthly over the course of the year. The other 90% of your base salary would be paid out as normal.

On a particular Grant Day, if the stock were trading at $500 per share, then each stock option would cost $200 (40% of $500), would have a strike price of $500, and would have an exercise window of 10 years.

There is a risk/reward calculation that each Netflix employee must do to determine how much of their compensation they want to take in the form of Netflix Stock Options, but this benefit has the potential to be _extremely_ lucrative given generous option price and the 10-year exercise window.

This benefit is so valuable that it might affect your [Minimum Acceptable Salary](/minimum-acceptable-salary/ ) calculation. 

## What to look out for when negotiating a Netflix job offer package

- **Netflix compensation packages are essentially a single component: base salary.** This makes negotiating with them more straightforward than other big tech companies where the offers have multiple components. Netflix doesn't offer equity, and sign-on bonuses are pretty rare.
- **Netflix is *very* sticky once they know their target.** If you tell them your salary history (especially current salary) or salary expectations, their offer will likely be very close to either of those numbers and they will not move very much from that starting point.
- **In general, the more senior and specialized the role, the more room there might be to negotiate.** The more senior the role, the more room there might be to negotiate. And even among similarly-leveled roles, the more specialized role may have more room to negotiate.
- **Netflix is often rigid with respect to the "level" offered.** They work hard to align candidates with levels and roles and will usually be pretty rigid with those assignments once they have been made. So if you feel you might be better aligned with a more senior level, bring that up as early in the recruitment or interview process as possible.
- **Netflix will often ask for competing offers—sharing those offers *may* be beneficial.** Many companies ask for competing offers to gather data on competitors or to dissuade the "I have lots of offers" bluff that many candidates use. But when Netflix is competing with companies like Google and Apple for candidates, they will often match competing offers if they're superior. Favorable market data can increase Netflix's flexibility when negotiating.
- **Netflix compensation packages include stock options equal to 5% of base salary.** This is a pretty valuable benefit that should be considered a part of their compensation package.
- **Netflix's Employee Stock Option Program can be an _extremely_ lucrative benefit.** One of Netflix's most valuable employee benefits is their Employee Stock Option Program, which allows employees to substitute Netflix stock options for base salary. Make sure to include this benefit along with the 5% stock option benefit when evaluating the quality of your netflix offer.
