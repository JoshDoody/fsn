	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>You need to negotiate your job offer and you don't have much time to learn how. </p>
			
			<p>Changing jobs is already stressful enough. <strong>The interview process is a <em>slog</em> that seems like it might never end</strong>: screening calls, technical interviews, loops, follow-ups, on-sites and it just seems to go on and on and on.</p>
			
			<p>If you make every move exactly right, you could get to the ultimate prize: A lucrative job offer.</p>
			
			<p>But it turns out that lucrative job offer is just the entrance to a hazy maze that you've encountered before. Once again, you find yourself staring into the Maze of Negotiation.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Last time you were here</strong> a few years ago, you were leveling up from L4 to L5, or you finally got an offer with the word "Senior" in the title. Maybe you just threw your hands up and got out of there as quickly as possible—why bother, right?—Or maybe you tried to navigate the Maze of Negotiation, fighting valiantly along the way, and just felt kind of outmaneuvered. You're not sure why, but things just didn't quite work out like you had hoped.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Here you are again, staring into the Maze of Negotiation, feeling that same queasy, uncertain feeling you felt last time.</strong></p>

			<p><strong>What sort of Dragons might be lurking?</strong> Recruiters, finance people, hiring committees, and cranky managers, who all seem to be trying to slow you down or take you out.</p>
			
			<p><strong>And what about the dangers you <em>can't</em> see?</strong> The Trap Doors hiding under seemingly-innocuous questions like "So if you come work for us, what are your salary expectations?" or "Tell me about one time you worked on a project that failed." Or, worst of all, what if they pull the offer?</p>
			
			<p>Or you could wade into the maze only to spend all your time running into dead ends.</p>
			
			<p><em>What if they lowball me?</em></p>
			
			<p><em>What if they say no?</em></p>
			
			<p>It feels like you <em>have to</em> navigate this maze if you really want to get paid what you're worth, but it seems like everything is working against you don't know if you can do this again:</p>

						<p>I am absolutely blown away by Salary Negotiation Mastery! Not only did I find it incredibly valuable and useful, but I had the pleasure of seeing the results first hand. <strong>I was able to negotiate a $22,000 increase in total compensation - that's a $13,000 increase in base salary and a $9,000 sign-on bonus - from Amazon!</strong> </p>

			<p>Here's the good news: People negotiate higher salaries all the time. Companies actually <em>expect</em> it. How do I know? Because I make a living helping people negotiate!</p>
				
			<p><strong>I am <em>your</em> Salary Negotiation Wizard.</strong> I'm here to help you navigate the Maze of Negotiation, just like I've helped hundreds of people in your exact situation. In the same way that you've been head-down learning how to be the best at your job, I've spent <em>years</em> becoming a Salary Negotiation expert, helping people earn <em>millions</em> more dollars.</p>
			
			<p>Not only do I know how to navigate the Maze of Negotiation along with the Scroll. <strong>I <em>wrote</em> the Scroll, and it's called Salary Negotiation Mastery.</strong></p>
			
			<p>It's a detailed, step-by-step process to negotiate your job offer and maximize your compensation without endangering the offer.</p>
			
			<p>In only a few hours, I'll show you <em>exactly</em> how to navigate the Maze of Negotiation you just entered. I'll show you <em>exactly</em> what to do and what to say from this moment until you emerge from the Maze of Negotiation with the absolute best possible version of your compensation package locked up.</p>
			
			<p>I know you don't have much time. I want this to be a slam-dunk decision for you, so here's what you need to know about this offer:</p>
			
      <ul class="checklist my-6">
        <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> <strong>The whole program takes only a few hours.</strong> You may have seen other programs where they try to cram as much stuff into one package as possible. They brag about how many hours of video, how many worksheets, and all that. This one is different: You're in a hurry, so there's no fluff. This program is exactly what you need to negotiate the best offer possible—no more and no less.</li>
				 <li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> <strong>I've used this exactly methodology for the past several years to help more than 150 people negotiate millions of dollars more for themselves.</strong> This is literally all I do and I'm <em>very</em> good at it.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> <strong>I will personally talk you through your strategy on the included 30-minute phone call.</strong> I talk to every Salary Negotiation Mastery customer to make sure you get the most out of the program.</li>
				<li><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> <strong>I guarantee Salary Negotiation Mastery will work for you.</strong> I'm so confident in this that I offer a simple guarantee: Try it, and if you don't <em>at least</em> make your money back just reach out and let me know and I'll happily refund our purchase. I call it the Happy Customer Guarantee and I stand by it. </li>
      </ul>
			
			<p>So what would a 16% improvement in your job offer be worth to you? Thousands of dollars? Tens of thousands?</p>

			<p>Okay, okay. I know what you're thinking.</p>

			<p>"Josh, even if I could learn to confidently negotiate a higher salary, wouldn't this risk the company rescinding my offer completely?"</p>

			<p>Not when you do it how I teach it.</p>

			<p>Salary Negotiation Mastery will show you a proven approach that is both collaborative and aggressive, and specifically designed to work <em>with</em> your recruiter to get the best possible result, not <em>against</em> them!</p>	
		
			<div class="flex flex-col items-center mb-5">
				<p class="text-4xl">

	    <h2 class="uppercase">How Salary Negotiation Mastery will get you the best possible compensation for your skills — so you can focus on the job instead of the money you missed out on making </h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>The program is designed to meet you exactly where you’re at, which is one of three places.</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>You have a job offer and you have a deadline to respond which is breathing down your neck. (No sweat. Inside the program, in a matter of minutes, I’ll show you exactly how to respond and open up negotiations.)</li>
				<li>You’ve already interviewed and don’t have an offer yet. (Cool. I’ll show you how to review salary expectations before negotiating so you hold the power right from the start.)</li>
				<li>You’re about to start the job search process (or plan to in the future) and want to make sure you set yourself up for interview success and the salary of your dreams. Smart cookie ;)</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Depending on where you’re at, here’s what I’ll be guiding you through inside Salary Negotiation Mastery.</p> 
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">1. Ace your interviews</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>If you haven’t gone through your interview yet, in this module I’ll show you how to:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Shift the interviewers’ mindset from ‘what’s the smallest number…’ to ‘how much do we have to offer to get them’</li>
				<li>Position yourself as the perfect candidate for the job without reciting your resume (they already have access to that!)</li>
				<li>Immediately increase the perceived value of having you in the role — which primes you for a breezy negotiation</li>
			</ul>
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">2. Know your numbers</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>Once you’ve nailed your interview, it’s essential you know 4 key numbers. I’ll show you how to:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Find your market value estimation so you’re starting from solid ground</li>
				<li>Calculate the money you need to feel great about saying yes to the job, taking into account a dozen categories (it’s probably going to add up to more than you think, which is why this piece is so important)</li>
				<li>Set your minimum acceptable salary, so you’re ready to negotiate specifically and effectively </li>
			</ul>
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">3. Receive the offer</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>Nice one! You’ve got your offer. Now the fun really begins. In this module, I’ll show you how to:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Get plenty of time to consider the offer so you don’t feel under pressure to accept an offer that doesn’t reflect the value of your skills and that you could spend the next 4 years resenting</li>
				<li>Analyze the offer in relation to your minimum acceptable salary, so you know which negotiation strategy to move forward with</li>
				<li>Balance multiple offers, if you have them (this is a delicate process and I’ll show you exactly how to manage and leverage them in an ethical way where you get the outcome you truly want)</li>
			</ul>
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">4. Build your counter</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>Now you’ve got time to develop a case before you respond and I’ll show you how to:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Decide exactly <em>what</em> to counter on and what to avoid bringing into the negotiation at the start (this is where many people go wrong when doing it on their own)</li>
				<li>Determine how “aggressive” you want to be in response (there are a number of things to consider here and varying levels of “aggression”) and what that means for your negotiation strategy </li>
				<li>Build your case in a way that highlights your specific value and goes far beyond just asking for a bit more money </li>
			</ul>
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">5. Negotiate like a pro</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>You’ve now got everything ready to start active negotiation and confidently handle it like a pro. In this module, I’ll show you how to:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Manage any nerves you feel about communicating with your future employer or losing the offer (this is not going to happen when you follow my methodology)</li>
				<li>Write your counter email so it WOWS the recruiter and sets a positive and collaborative tone for the whole negotiation </li>
				<li>Exactly what to do when you get a response to your counter — we cover all the options here so you can evaluate and move forward with complete confidence (I even give you a foolproof script you can use if they request a phone call)</li>
				<li>Create your final ask from a place of strength </li>
			</ul>
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">6. Make your decision</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>It’s decision time. Once the negotiation is complete, I’ll show you how to:
</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Make the best decision for you, based on all the work you’ve done so far</li>
				<li>Say yes to the offer and what logistical information you’ll want to clarify when doing so</li>
				<li>Say no to the offer respectfully and assess where you go next </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>This is a thorough, no-fluff, results-focused program that gives you <em>everything</em> you need to conduct a masterful negotiation that gets you the best compensation package available — even if you’ve never negotiated in your life before.</p>

			      <p>I’m very nervous about negotiating. I felt that working with a professional would help take some of the pressure off.</p>

						<p>Working with Josh made the whole process a lot less stressful. He was very responsive and I think I got a substantially better offer than I could have on my own. <strong>I went from a vague offer of ~$200k first year total compensation to $258k.</strong> At a rough guess, I think I could have gotten to ~$220k on my own? So that’s a big win and a good cost/benefit. I also learned more about the process for next time.</p>

			<p>If your offer is $60k or higher and you follow the steps inside Salary Negotiation Mastery, I can guarantee that you’ll break even on your investment <em>at an absolute minimum</em>. If for some reason you don’t, I’ll refund you the full cost of the program.</p>

			<p>If your offer is $250k or higher, you can absolutely benefit from this program. However, due to the intricacies that may be included in a package of that size, you may prefer to work with me privately to coach you through the negotiation process.</p>

			      <p>My past negotiations have honestly been terrible where I never felt like I had the upper hand. Josh's coaching gave me confidence in the negotiation process. Because I knew Josh had gone through this before, I knew I wasn't asking anything too crazy / offensive of Apple. We ended up negotiating <strong>$35,000 more in base salary, $300,000 more total equity (vesting over four years), and $25,000 more sign on bonus</strong>.</p>

      <div class="acc-hide">
        <p>Absolutely! Salary Negotiation Mastery includes a 30-minute phone call with me so we can talk through your specific situation and make sure you get the absolute most out of the program.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="acc-open">
      <h6 class="text-black">I’d really like to negotiate my salary using Josh’s methods but I don’t think I have time as the company is already expecting a response from me</h6>
      <div class="acc-hide">
        <p>I’ve got you covered. As soon as you purchase the program, you’ll have access to an email template which you can use to email your future employer and request time to respond. You’re not going to run out of time. They want you to join their team and they will wait!</p>

				<p>The program materials are concise and streamlined to allow you to work through them in a time-efficient way, so you’ll be able to negotiate your salary within a matter of hours if you choose to.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="acc-open">
      <h6 class="text-black">I’ve already communicated my salary expectations, am I screwed?</h6>
      <div class="acc-hide">
        <p>No. I’ll show you exactly how to handle the negotiation even though you’ve already communicated your expectations. It’s worth noting though, if you haven’t communicated salary expectations yet, don’t! I’ll show you exactly what to do instead inside the program.</p>

      <div class="acc-hide">
        <p>Yes! There are only a few industries where you might struggle to negotiate: Academia, government, and teaching. If you're in an industry other than those, Salary Negotiation Mastery will work for you! Try it and I'll refund your purchase if you don't at least make your money back.</p>

        <p>I get it. You’re great at your job and proud of your work but you want to take a tactful approach when negotiating. You’re like 99% of my clients! This is why I teach you how to negotiate in a way that’s both aggressive <em>and</em> collaborative rather than confrontational and abrasive. I believe this is a big part of the reason why those who work with me get such phenomenal results.</p>

      <div class="acc-hide">
        <p>Go for it (no really)! We all have to start somewhere, and that’s exactly how I learned a lot of what I now teach. Bear in mind that you won’t get access to my proven methodology that’s helped thousands of other people negotiate their salary with phenomenal results, the tried-and-tested email swipe templates, or the inside secrets I’ve gathered over my seven years of being a salary negotiation expert. (For example, if your plan is to go back and ask for what you want, you’re setting yourself up to get the opposite.)</p>

        <p>100%. You don’t need to have any experience at negotiating for this to work. When you use my salary negotiation method, scripts, and tactics, you’re going to get yourself a higher salary.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="acc-open">
      <h6 class="text-black">Can I negotiate my salary if this is my first job?</h6>
      <div class="acc-hide">
        <p>The main reason to negotiate is that there might be room to negotiate. Whether you’re a recent college grad looking for your first full-time job, or an experienced executive looking to level up, you'll only know if there's room to negotiate by trying it.</p>

				<p>As a humble guy, it’s hard to say I’m the “world’s best” but the results and reputation I’ve built in this niche make it hard to argue with! In the 7+ years I’ve been a professional salary negotiation coach, I’ve:</p>
			
				<ul>
					<li>Personally helped 150+ one-on-one clients negotiate <strong>>$7.3million</strong> more income in <em>just the first year</em> after working with me and >$12million in the four years after</li>
					<li>Coached people just like you to improve their job offers by an <strong>average of $47,273</strong></li>
					<li>Helped <strong>my clients maximize their compensation packages</strong> through the art of salary negotiation (an art you can master yourself in a matter of hours with this program)</li>
					<li>Guided <strong>over 1,000 people through my tried-and-tested Fearless Salary Negotiation methodology</strong> (yep, that’s the one I’m going to walk you through step-by-step)</li>
					<li>Been involved in negotiations with companies including Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Github, Tesla, @WalmartLabs, Zillow, Fastly, Bloomberg, Red Hat, Verizon, IBM, Microsoft, Twitter, Opendoor, and other companies you've heard of</li>
					<li>Done all of this <strong>entirely behind the scenes</strong>, so every result my clients and customers have achieved is through their own direct communication with recruiters</li>
				</ul>
			
			
				<p>You might be wondering how I got into this, considering nobody else on the planet seems to be doing it (and certainly not in the way I teach it).</p>

				<p>The short answer is: I started my career as an engineer and worked as a consultant for a software company that helped organizations manage their compensation plans, so I got a front row seat to exactly how they paid people and apportioned budget.</p>

				<p>Plus, I was a hiring manager and helped build a team of 25 people, which included negotiating salaries on the company side.</p>

				<p>I didn't negotiate my salary at the start of my career, but soon realized I'd left a ton of money on the table along the way. <strong>Once I started negotiating, I doubled my salary in three years.</strong></p>

				<p>Take it from me, the sooner you start, the better.</p>

				<p>My skillstack is unique and valuable. That's why I created Salary Negotiation Mastery: so you can get access to all of the skills I've mastered and use them yourself to get paid exactly what you deserve in the smoothest, fastest, most collaborative way possible.</p>

				<p>This program won't just teach you how to negotiate <em>more</em> compensation. It'll teach you how to negotiate the <em>maximum</em> compensation.</p>

	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">			
			
			<p>Your <em>best</em> opportunity to negotiate a higher salary is before you start a new role. While it is possible to negotiate once you're in the job, it's all too easy to get stuck in a company's regular "merit increase" cycle which can ultimately leave you frustrated, short on compensation, and wishing you'd negotiated better when you had the chance.</p>

			<p>My goal with Salary Negotiation Mastery isn't just to show you exactly how to get a higher salary, it's to make sure that when you go home after your first day at your new job and when your head hits the pillow at night, you know deep in your bones that you're making as much money as you possibly can, and you never have to wonder if you should have asked for more.</p>

			<p>Instead, you can focus on enjoying your work, excelling at it, moving up in your career, and putting that extra salary to good use!</p>

			<p>The downpayment on the house you've been side-eyeing for months.</p>

			<p>The luxurious family vacation you've never quite been able to afford.</p>

			<p>The lifestyle conveniences that give you your precious time back.</p>

			<p>It could all be available to you on the other side of one negotiation. </p>

			      <p>With Josh’s help, I negotiated increased offers from Facebook, Amazon and GitHub. GitHub was the lowest offer, but they came up quite a lot with a <strong>$25k signing bonus, a $15k increase in salary, and a $32k annual increase in equity</strong>.
