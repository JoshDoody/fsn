			<p>Hey there software engineer,</p>

			<p>Your coding skills are top-notch. It's why you've finally received that coveted "<em>pinch me</em>" job offer.</p>

			<p>The one you've spent weeks (maybe months?) interviewing for, sweating over, and dreaming of.</p>

			<p>You <em>know</em> you deserve this job. There's just one question that's bugging you.</p>

			<p><strong>They want your skills, but are you sure they're paying what you're worth?</strong></p>

			<p>The last thing you want to do is accept the offer as-is and then spend every day you're in that job wondering: <em>What if?</em></p>

			<p><em>What if they lowballed me and had the budget to pay me thousands more all along?</em></p>

			<p><em>What if my colleague is getting paid more than me even though our skills are comparable?</em></p>

			<p><em>What if I could have provided an even better future for myself and my family simply by having the confidence to negotiate based on what my expertise is truly worth?</em></p>

			<p>That last one is the real kicker. You can code like your life depends on it, but advocating for and selling <em>yourself</em>? That's a whole other arena. One typically filled with brain freeze and awkward silences.</p>

			<p>Here's the great news.</p>

			<p>Software engineers negotiate higher salaries all the time. Tech companies actually <em>expect</em> it.</p>
			
	    <h2 class="uppercase">You could be confidently negotiating your offer in a matter of hours</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">

			<p><strong>And just like you mastered coding, you can master the art of confidently negotiating your salary so that no money is left on the table—in a matter of <em>hours</em>. (I promise the learning curve is significantly shorter.)</strong></p>

				</p>
			</div> -->
			
			<p>Okay, okay. I know what you're thinking.</p>

			<p>"Josh, even if I could learn to confidently negotiate a higher salary, wouldn't this risk the company rescinding my offer completely?"</p>

			<p>Not when you do it how I teach it.</p>

			<p>Seriously, I have NEVER seen a tech company rescind an offer because it was negotiated. And I've worked with hundreds of software engineers to help them add thousands to their compensation packages.</p>

			      <p>I've never negotiated an extra dollar for myself in any job offer or raise, and I had tried a couple times before. <strong>The fact that Josh helped me get an additional $74,000 was amazing.</strong> It wasn't unexpected to get more money, but it was unexpected to get that much more money.</p>

	    <h2 class="uppercase">How Salary Negotiation Mastery will get you the best possible compensation for your skills — so you can focus on the job instead of the money you missed out on making </h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>The program is designed to meet you exactly where you’re at, which is one of three places.</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>You have a job offer and you have a deadline to respond which is breathing down your neck. (No sweat. Inside the program, in a matter of minutes, I’ll show you exactly how to respond and open up negotiations.)</li>
				<li>You’ve already interviewed and don’t have an offer yet. (Cool. I’ll show you how to review salary expectations before negotiating so you hold the power right from the start.)</li>
				<li>You’re about to start the job search process (or plan to in the future) and want to make sure you set yourself up for interview success and the salary of your dreams. Smart cookie ;)</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Depending on where you’re at, here’s what I’ll be guiding you through inside Salary Negotiation Mastery.</p> 
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">1. Ace your interviews</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>If you haven’t gone through your interview yet, in this module I’ll show you how to:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Shift the interviewers’ mindset from ‘what’s the smallest number…’ to ‘how much do we have to offer to get them’</li>
				<li>Position yourself as the perfect candidate for the job without reciting your resume (they already have access to that!)</li>
				<li>Immediately increase the perceived value of having you in the role — which primes you for a breezy negotiation</li>
			</ul>
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">2. Know your numbers</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>Once you’ve nailed your interview, it’s essential you know 4 key numbers. I’ll show you how to:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Find your market value estimation so you’re starting from solid ground</li>
				<li>Calculate the money you need to feel great about saying yes to the job, taking into account a dozen categories (it’s probably going to add up to more than you think, which is why this piece is so important)</li>
				<li>Set your minimum acceptable salary, so you’re ready to negotiate specifically and effectively </li>
			</ul>
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">3. Receive the offer</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>Nice one! You’ve got your offer. Now the fun really begins. In this module, I’ll show you how to:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Get plenty of time to consider the offer so you don’t feel under pressure to accept an offer that doesn’t reflect the value of your skills and that you could spend the next 4 years resenting</li>
				<li>Analyze the offer in relation to your minimum acceptable salary, so you know which negotiation strategy to move forward with</li>
				<li>Balance multiple offers, if you have them (this is a delicate process and I’ll show you exactly how to manage and leverage them in an ethical way where you get the outcome you truly want)</li>
			</ul>
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">4. Build your counter</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>Now you’ve got time to develop a case before you respond and I’ll show you how to:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Decide exactly <em>what</em> to counter on and what to avoid bringing into the negotiation at the start (this is where many people go wrong when doing it on their own)</li>
				<li>Determine how “aggressive” you want to be in response (there are a number of things to consider here and varying levels of “aggression”) and what that means for your negotiation strategy </li>
				<li>Build your case in a way that highlights your specific value and goes far beyond just asking for a bit more money </li>
			</ul>
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">5. Negotiate like a pro</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>You’ve now got everything ready to start active negotiation and confidently handle it like a pro. In this module, I’ll show you how to:</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Manage any nerves you feel about communicating with your future employer or losing the offer (this is not going to happen when you follow my methodology)</li>
				<li>Write your counter email so it WOWS the recruiter and sets a positive and collaborative tone for the whole negotiation </li>
				<li>Exactly what to do when you get a response to your counter — we cover all the options here so you can evaluate and move forward with complete confidence (I even give you a foolproof script you can use if they request a phone call)</li>
				<li>Create your final ask from a place of strength </li>
			</ul>
			
	    <h3 class="uppercase">6. Make your decision</h2>
	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">
			
			<p>It’s decision time. Once the negotiation is complete, I’ll show you how to:
</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Make the best decision for you, based on all the work you’ve done so far</li>
				<li>Say yes to the offer and what logistical information you’ll want to clarify when doing so</li>
				<li>Say no to the offer respectfully and assess where you go next </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>This is a thorough, no-fluff, results-focused program that gives you <em>everything</em> you need to conduct a masterful negotiation that gets you the best compensation package available — even if you’ve never negotiated in your life before.</p>

			      <p>I’m very nervous about negotiating. I felt that working with a professional would help take some of the pressure off.</p>

						<p>Working with Josh made the whole process a lot less stressful. He was very responsive and I think I got a substantially better offer than I could have on my own. <strong>I went from a vague offer of ~$200k first year total compensation to $258k.</strong> At a rough guess, I think I could have gotten to ~$220k on my own? So that’s a big win and a good cost/benefit. I also learned more about the process for next time.</p>

			<p>That really depends on your job role and original offer. Based on my detailed records and data of the results my clients have gotten (what can I say, I’m meticulous), here’s an idea of the higher salary you could negotiate simply by following my proven methodology.</p>

			<p>If your offer is $250k or higher, you can absolutely benefit from this program. However, due to the intricacies that may be included in a package of that size, you may prefer to work with me privately to coach you through the negotiation process.</p>

We ended up negotiating <strong>$35,000 more in base salary, $300,000 more total equity (vesting over four years), and $25,000 more sign on bonus</strong>.</p>

        <p>I get it. You’re a beast at coding but you want to take a tactful approach when negotiating. You’re like 99% of my clients! This is why I teach you how to negotiate in a way that’s both aggressive <em>and</em> collaborative rather than confrontational and abrasive.

	      <h2 class="mb-10 uppercase sans-serif">I’m Josh Doody, the world’s best salary negotiation expert for software engineers and managers</h2>
				<p>As a humble guy, it’s hard to say I’m the “world’s best” but the results and reputation I’ve built in this niche make it hard to argue with! In the 7+ years I’ve been a professional software salary negotiation coach, I’ve:</p>
			
				<ul>
				<li>Shown software professionals how to negotiate <strong>>$7.3million</strong> more income in j<em>ust the first year</em> after working with me and >$12million in the four years after</li>
				<li>Coached people just like you to improve their job offers by an <strong>average of $47,273</strong></li>
				<li>Helped <strong>over 150 private clients maximize their compensation packages</strong> through the art of salary negotiation (an art you can master yourself in a matter of hours with this program)</li>
				<li>Guided <strong>over 1000 people through my tried-and-tested Fearless Salary Negotiation methodology</strong> (yep, that’s the one I’m going to walk you through step-by-step)</li>
				<li><strong>Never had anyone I’ve worked with lose a job offer</strong> from any tech company</li>
				<li>Been involved in negotiations with companies including Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Github, Tesla, @WalmartLabs, Zillow, Fastly, Bloomberg, Red Hat, Verizon, IBM, Microsoft, Twitter, Opendoor, and other companies you've heard of</li>
				<li>Done all of this <strong>entirely behind the scenes</strong>, so every result my clients and customers have achieved is through their own direct communication with recruiters</li>
				</ul>
			
			
				<p>You might be wondering how I got into this, considering nobody else on the planet seems to be doing it (and certainly not in the way I teach it).</p>

				<p>The short answer is: I used to <em>be</em> a software engineer. I've also been a consultant for a software company that helped organisations manage their compensation plans, so I got a front row seat to exactly how they paid people and apportioned budget.</p>

				<p>Plus, I was a hiring manager and helped build a team of 25 people, which included negotiating salaries on the company side.</p>

				<p>I didn't negotiate my salary at the start of my career, but soon realized I'd left a ton of money on the table along the way. <strong>Once I started negotiating, I doubled my salary in three years.</strong></p>

				<p>Take it from me, the sooner you start, the better.</p>

				<p>My skillstack is unique and valuable. That's why I created Salary Negotiation Mastery: so you can get access to all of the skills I've mastered and use them yourself to get paid exactly what you deserve in the smoothest, fastest, most collaborative way possible.</p>

				<p>This program won't just teach you how to negotiate <em>more</em> compensation. It'll teach you how to negotiate the <em>maximum</em> compensation.</p>

	    <hr class="my-8 w-16">			
			
			<p>Your <em>best</em> opportunity to negotiate a higher salary is before you start a new role. While it is possible to negotiate once you're in the job, it's all too easy to get stuck in a company's regular "merit increase" cycle which can ultimately leave you frustrated, short on compensation, and wishing you'd negotiated better when you had the chance.</p>

			<p>My goal with Salary Negotiation Mastery isn't just to show you exactly how to get a higher salary, it's to make sure that when you go home after your first day at your new job and when your head hits the pillow at night, you know deep in your bones that you're making as much money as you possibly can, and you never have to wonder if you should have asked for more.</p>

			<p>Instead, you can focus on enjoying your work, excelling at it, moving up in your career, and putting that extra salary to good use!</p>

			<p>The downpayment on the house you've been side-eyeing for months.</p>

			<p>The luxurious family vacation you've never quite been able to afford.</p>

			<p>The lifestyle conveniences that give you your precious time back.</p>

			<p>It could all be available to you on the other side of one negotiation. </p>

			      <p>With Josh’s help, I negotiated increased offers from Facebook, Amazon and GitHub. GitHub was the lowest offer, but they came up quite a lot with a <strong>$25k signing bonus, a $15k increase in salary, and a $32k annual increase in equity</strong>. The offers got close enough to each other that I could decide based on other more intangible factors and choose the opportunity that was the most compelling for me personally.</p>
