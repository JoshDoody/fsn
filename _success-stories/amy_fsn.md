**The money I spent on your book was the best ROI on anything I've bought. :)**

I just used your counter offer email template to negotiate for a new job, which was only the second time in my life I have negotiated an offer.

**I got an increase of $11k for my offer after negotiation, which is $6k more than I expected them to renegotiate to.** I literally would never have asked for that much if you hadn't insisted on a minimum 10% ask in your book.

**I'm honestly shocked that it worked.** And the recruiter told me how great it was to have a list of all the reasons why I deserve more, so that they could send it to the appropriate people to get everything approved.

Thanks for helping me get a great salary! The money I spent on your book was the best ROI on anything I've bought. :)
