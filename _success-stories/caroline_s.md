I just want to thank you for your guidance throughout this process! **I have been putting off asking for a promotion for at least a year now and I have read so many different articles with advice, but your writing really spoke to me and encouraged me to just go for it.** You provided so much clarity and really simplified this process for those of us who really don't know where to begin.

I asked for a promotion yesterday and I got great feedback. **My manager was actually so happy to hear of my interest in career growth** (something I have pretty much avoided talking about altogether), **and said she agrees that it is deserved and that she's going to do whatever she can to help make it happen.** So for now, the hard part is done and the end goal is in sight. :)

I can't thank you enough!
