**The process worked like magic.**

I recently negotiated a new job offer that I consider way above what they offered me first. It’s a software engineering management position, and initially I was offered 160k+ with no sign on bonus. **But I followed your guide I negotiated to 180k+ with 20k+ sign on bonus. That’s a nice 42k increase, or over 25% more than what they provided first.**

I’m not trying to negotiate just to be greedy and get more, but to negotiate a compensation that I can work hard without distraction thinking I’m underpaid for the hard work.

And your guide played a key role. **I followed the exact process you outlined**—ask recruiter to wait, write a convincing counter offer email, and prepare a negotiation script before talking on the phone—**and it worked like magic**.
