**I was concerned about the price of the coaching relative to what I thought I was going to get out of it.**

Josh helped me ask for a larger salary increase than I would have by myself. **I got a $5,000 increase in starting salary – that alone more than paid for the cost of coaching.** I felt like I was able to get close to what my current market value is. Josh also helped with non-salary items, helping me get a significant increase in stock options.

Because he’s very experienced, Josh provides a level-headed approach to negotiations. **I like having a more objective party walk me through the process and game out scenarios.** I also appreciated that Josh is clear in his communication and very responsive.

On top of helping me get a larger increase than I otherwise would have gotten, **I now have some new moves and approaches for negotiating my compensation package in the future.**
