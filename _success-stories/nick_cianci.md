I had three offers and one of them was through a recruiting agency. I had never been in this situation and didn't know how to deal with a pushy recruiter and waiting to fully explore my other offers. Josh has valuable knowledge and experience and was able to give me advice tailored to my specific situation when I didn't know what to do.

He gave me really valuable advice and simplified the negotiation situation for me. Just follow his negotiation strategy and you will definitely raise your salary or receive better benefits.

For a small amount of money I was able to speak to Josh about my situation. With his help, I was able to gain $2K in base salary. All I needed to do was send an email and make a phone call. Just follow the process and you will get a better offer!

Here are some other highlights from our strategy session:

1.  We did a mock negotiation to practice different scenarios.
2.  We discussed a precise plan of action to get the best offer for my situation.
3.  Josh helped me to realize that I held much more power in my situation. It costs companies a great deal of money to get to the point of giving someone an offer. They will work with you if they are a company that is worth working for.

Josh has a lot of great experience that really became valuable during the negotiation process. The benefits I received from this experience absolutely outweighed the cost of the strategy sessions!

I'm more excited to begin my new job because they were willing to negotiate, giving me confidence that they value me as an employee. It feels good to get a win-win result for everyone.
