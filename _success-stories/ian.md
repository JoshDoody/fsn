I've been consuming your blog since I applied to a new frontend software engineering position at CrossFit llc. 

CrossFit isn't a FAANG company but **I'm happy to report that using your templates and advice I was able to add $10,000 to my base salary**.

I've never done this before and your blog/podcasts/email course gave me the confidence to negotiate my offer where previously I would have been satisfied with the initial one.
