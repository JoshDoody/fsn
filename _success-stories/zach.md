 I was able to almost double my sign-on bonus and equity, **resulting in a $100,000 increase over the original offer in year one total compensation and a total increase of $405,000 over five years.** If I had taken the original offer, reaching my retirement savings objective would be delayed by seven years! 
  
 I'd recommend working with Josh at a certain comp level. **As the numbers get bigger, you need more professional support.** I hired a financial advisor when my retirement savings approached $1 million. Same thing here.
