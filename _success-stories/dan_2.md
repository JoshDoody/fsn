  With solid support from Josh, I had a productive and constructive conversation with the company and got a good result and more clarity. I went from 0.4% to 0.5% equity and we’ve set specific expectations on how this might increase in future as I hit growth milestones. **I've got peace of mind that the company is valuing me appropriately and will recognize my future growth.**

I didn’t know how to ask for more/what I'm worth. I didn’t hesitate to hire Josh. He was strongly recommended and that was all that mattered. 

**What I liked most about working with Josh was understanding how to frame the asks in a way that isn't just "give me more”.** I also learned how to convey my value and align on it, how to keep the conversation focused, and how to think bigger on what I'm worth.
