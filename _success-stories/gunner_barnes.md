Just wanted to say thank you for the resources you provide with respect to salary negotiation.

I've been a software engineer for just over 10 years now, and **despite changing employers 5 times, my current move was the only one where I did any negotiating.** I just didn't know any better before now.

**Thanks to your insight, I was able to negotiate a low-ball offer (less than I was currently making) up 27%!** I didn't give a number first (which I'm sure was the reason for the low-ball), but politely asked for a reset.

I possibly still left some money on the table, but they came up above my minimum number, and didn't reduce equity at all to do so. **I'll absolutely be recommending you to everyone I know that is looking to make a move!**

Thanks again,
