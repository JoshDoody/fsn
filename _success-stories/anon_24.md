I was worried about not having experience in negotiating with Amazon, given the financial opportunity I had before me.

My primary concerns about hiring Josh were around the upfront payment versus expected return and if I would be better off working with a negotiation company that had a team of people who could help me.

**I felt like I was in very good hands with Josh.** His experience was very useful starting with our initial call. I appreciated the excellent communication and zero pressures about the process. He gave me clear steps on how to best proceed and **we put together a strong case to anchor high from the onset.**

**We ended up at the highest end of Amazon’s range**, which is something that I don’t think I could have done on my own, as I’m not sure I would’ve had the confidence to anchor as high as we did in the counter offer.

I feel confident going into my new role that I did my best at the negotiation table and won’t ruminate on this decision going forward. I have also acquired some useful skills to help me with future negotiations or help other family members with their future negotiations.
