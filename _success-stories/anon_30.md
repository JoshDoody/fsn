**I was looking for help with salary negotiation because I was worried about making decisions and what words to use in my negotiations.** I'd never successfully negotiated for more than a signing bonus in the past, and I’d been through a really rough patch in my personal life over the last 6 months, which depleted my capacity to advocate for myself without support. 

I appreciated Josh’s ability to quickly and thoroughly answer all of my questions and going through “what if” scenarios with smart, easy-to-use scripts.

**I negotiated for $20,000 more salary and $25,000 more equity.** Josh's thoughtful questions allowed me to find clarity in the process about what I wanted.

**As an added benefit, I got interview tips for next time I’m looking.** Josh taught me how to use the goals and challenges that the company, team or manager is facing and to focus my answers on how I’d help address them, which makes interviewing much more intuitive than using the STAR method. The biggest win was gaining experience to withstand the discomfort of having hard conversations and have it work out. **Now feel more comfortable asking for what I want.**

I’d recommend working with Josh. He’s extremely knowledgeable, trustworthy, fast, and flexible.
