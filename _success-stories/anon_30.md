**I was looking for help with salary negotiation because I was worried about making decisions and what words to use.** I’ve been through a really rough patch over the last 6 months and it’s depleted my capacity to make tough calls. 

I appreciated Josh’s ability to quickly and thoroughly answer all of my questions and going through “what if” scenarios with smart, easy-to-use scripts. 

**I negotiated for $20,000 more salary and $25,000 more equity.** I’m happy with the final result, especially since I didn’t bring much clarity to the process regarding what I wanted.

**As an added benefit, I basically got interview tips for next time I’m looking.** Josh taught me how to use the goals and challenges that the company, team or manager is facing and to focus my answers on how I’d help address them, which will make interviewing a trillion times easier than using the STAR method. I also gained experience withstanding the discomfort of having hard conversations and having it work out and **I now feel more comfortable asking for what I want.**

I’d recommend working with Josh. He’s extremely knowledgeable, trustworthy, fast, and flexible.
