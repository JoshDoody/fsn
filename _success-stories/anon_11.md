 I'm very nervous about negotiating. Working with Josh made the whole process a lot less stressful. I think I got a substantially better offer than I could have on my own. **I went from a vague offer of ~$200k first year total compensation to $258k.** At a rough guess, I think I could have gotten to ~$220k on my own? So that's a big win and a good cost/benefit.

I'm very nervous about negotiating. I felt that working with a professional would help take some of the pressure off.

Working with Josh made the whole process a lot less stressful. He was very responsive and I think I got a substantially better offer than I could have on my own. **I went from a vague offer of ~$200k first year total compensation to $258k.** At a rough guess, I think I could have gotten to ~$220k on my own? So that's a big win and a good cost/benefit. I also learned more about the process for next time.
