 I've set myself up for compounding increases in incoming cash by starting my Google salary and equity higher than I would have otherwise. I feel like I got the best deal that was available to me and I didn't leave anything on the table. **If I hadn't hired Josh, I probably would be sitting here today still wondering, "Man, could I have easily bumped this by a bunch of more money?"**.
product: Salary Negotiation Coaching
result_summary: Higher salary and equity than would have been possible otherwise.

In the end, **the most impactful thing Josh did was a line in a two-paragraph email** that essentially said, "Instead of $211k per year, I want $250k." **That doesn't seem like I paid for much!**

However, there's a lot of things that went into that email. **Where do we want to pressure them? Which dimensions do we want to go on?** It was knowing the correct things to ask for (cash or equity), knowing the correct amount to ask for, and knowing how to come up with a narrative around why they should try to reach my number. That email wasn't just a number, it was a story.
