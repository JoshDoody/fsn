**I used the _Fearless Salary Negotiation_ strategy for negotiating an offer and went from $95,000 with a title of Software Engineer 1 to $105,000 with a title of Software Engineer 2\. Now I can pay off my student loans and buy a house more quickly.**

Six months later, I did it again! This time, I one-upped that by turning a $125,000 offer to a $145,000 offer.

That's $30,000 in additional salary thanks to this truly wonderful resource.
