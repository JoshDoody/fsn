  Before hiring Josh, I wasn't sure if paying $3,000 was worth the money or not. Now, I am convinced beyond doubt. **I negotiated a $45,000 increase in signing bonus and vesting equity.** I'm very excited and grateful for the outcome. It means salary, etc. is out of my mind now and I can just walk into the job with single-minded focus on getting the job done.

Before hiring Josh, **I wasn't sure if paying $3,000 was worth the money or not.** Now, I am convinced beyond doubt. 

The results were phenomenal. **I negotiated a $45,000 increase in signing bonus and vesting equity.** I'm very excited and grateful for the outcome. It means salary, etc. is out of my mind now and I can just walk into the job with single-minded focus on getting the job done.

I learned two important lessons. First, always negotiate. You never know what's possible. Second, know your worth. Collect as much data and present a very strong case making it hard for the recruiter / hiring team to ignore your request.

I only have good things to say about the experience. I thoroughly enjoyed how professional Josh was. His strength is the conviction in his voice. **For anybody who is not very experienced in salary negotiation, I think they need a coach like Josh.**
