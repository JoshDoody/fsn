He helped me write a strong counter offer. **I negotiated $14,000 more in salary and $90,000 more in equity vesting over a four-year period.** Josh also helped me deal with my nerves throughout the process, which made the whole process less stressful.

I didn't have a good sense of how much to ask for and when to negotiate vs raise questions. I had no hesitation about hiring Josh. He came recommended by a friend and this was my first negotiation of this kind so I felt I could learn things.

I'd recommend working with Josh. He was professional, fun to work with, very responsive, and always gave me his honest opinion. **Crucially, I felt he put my interests first.**
