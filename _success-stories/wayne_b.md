  Josh provided the insight and guidance I needed to be confident throughout the negotiation process. I know that because I had Josh's help, I asked for more that I would have on my own. I negotiated **$20,000 more in salary and a substantial increase in equity**.  
  
  **Josh also put my own desires ahead of his own**; there was a part of the negotiation process where he could have tried to influence me in a direction that would result in a larger fee for himself. Instead he discussed the options with me, provided me with enough information, and **encouraged me to make the decision that was best for me.**

I wanted increased confidence in knowing what and how much to ask for. I also wanted help navigating the negotiation process, since I had never done it before. The initial cost of coaching was one of my biggest concerns. However, once I reached that tipping point, it was helpful to have had paid the initial fee as I felt I could ask Josh for any help that I needed.

I would highly recommend working with Josh as a salary negotiation coach. The most beneficial part was being prepared for each step of the negotiation process. **Having an idea of what was next allowed me to be prepared for each conversation and provided me the confidence during the conversations.** A very close second is the email drafts. They were short, respectable, and to the point. This was a huge help as **I did not need to worry about offending the recruiter;** I would have worried about this if writing them on my own. 

I learned what the process is like and a few of the variations that can take place during a negotiation. I also learned that it's okay to take time when responding to recruiters. **Had I been doing this on my own I would have felt pressure to respond immediately to the recruiter.** Now I know this is not required, moreover, it's expected that the decision process takes time and is respected by recruiters. Having learned firsthand what the negotiation process is like, I feel confident I could do it on my own next time around. Although, I may still want to make use of Josh’s expertise during my next large negotiation.
