As one who had not really ever negotiated my salary (certainly not successfully) before, **I was able to increase the original offer by $9,000 (12%)**.

I'm looking forward to using that money initially to increase my retirement savings, pay off some debts and then to add even more to my retirement accounts.

Thanks again for creating a wonderful resource!
