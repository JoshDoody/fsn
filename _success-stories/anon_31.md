   Josh’s coaching helped me be patient and avoid my usual pitfalls of folding too early. **Given that the recruiter was initially fairly persistent in trying to get me to suggest a range at first, I really had to lean into Josh’s coaching to avoid doing so.**  
   
   I thought that the process and the end result were better than what I would've done myself. **I have confidence that the offer I got from the recruiter was as good as I could get, even though we couldn't improve it further because it turned out it was truly the ceiling for the role.** I would recommend working with Josh due to the amount of coaching that he went through with me, which I consider helpful far beyond this particular negotiation.

I didn’t have confidence in my own persistence in negotiations. **My concern was that I'd accept an offer too early** partly due to excitement around the position offered and partly due to anxiety that an opportunity might not last long enough in the current market.

**Josh’s coaching helped me be patient and avoid my usual pitfalls of folding too early.** I have a better and practical understanding now on how to avoid boxing my offer in with providing the number to the recruiter first. **Given that the recruiter was initially fairly persistent in trying to get me to suggest a range at first, I really had to lean into Josh’s coaching to avoid doing so.** It did work, even though it took some back and forth. I liked how thorough and effective my syncs with Josh were and the amount of effort and detail that went into understanding my fit for the role, the negotiating position of the recruiter, and the communication needed for each step of the negotiation.

I thought that the process and the end result were better than what I would've done myself. **I have confidence that the offer I got from the recruiter was as good as I could get, even though we couldn't improve it further because it turned out it was truly the ceiling for the role.** I also understand the current market value better and have more confidence in my current role.

**I would recommend working with Josh due to the amount of coaching that he went through with me, which I consider helpful far beyond this particular negotiation.** I've learned to be more patient with negotiation and how to give myself more time to make tactical steps by relying on email rather than phone calls. I also found the customization of the negotiation to be valuable.
