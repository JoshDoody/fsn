I ended up getting the job, and I was able to negotiate from them an extra $6,000! I definitely wouldn't have been able to do that without Josh's help!

The extra $6,000 helped me afford my dream apartment in a safe, well-kept area where my family can rest easy. It's an apartment that impresses and that I enjoy coming home to!

Not only that, but I am less worried about when my student loan payments need to start being paid back because I know I have enough to make my payments.
