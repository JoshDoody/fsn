**I wanted to maximize offer value and come off as a professional when asking for more money.** I wasn't sure if I'd get an ROI from hiring Josh, given the high cost; probably wouldn't have done it if not for Patrick McKenzie (patio11) recommending Josh's service.

I'm glad I did. Josh gave me great email drafts and talking points. **I negotiated $75k more in salary and a $25k bonus.** It’s good to know I’m valued at the company and helps with my motivation.

I'd recommend Josh’s service. **I think it has a good EV (expected value) for high earners.**
