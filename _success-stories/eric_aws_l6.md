  I reached out to Josh for coaching because I was unsure of what the potential ceiling was, and was concerned I had low balled myself when the recruiter initially asked about my salary expectations. The outcome was fantastic! **I felt Josh had my best interest in mind throughout the entire process**, and he got me almost back to the initial counter. I had no idea we could get the bump that we did. I negotiated **$14k more in base salary, $32k in year 1 bonus, $50k in year 2 bonus, and 500 more RSUs**.
product: Salary Negotiation Coaching
result_summary: Additional $14,000 in base salary, $32,000 in year 1 bonus, $50,000 in year 2 bonus, 500 more RSUs

I reached out to Josh for coaching because I was unsure of what the potential ceiling was, and **was concerned I had low balled myself when the recruiter initially asked about my salary expectations**. My concern about hiring him was potentially **being too aggressive and having the offer rescinded**.

Working with Josh was great. He is very professional and timely. He did not hesitate to make himself available and he did a nice job of outlining the potential next steps.

I would recommend anyone to work with Josh when negotiating salary. **It is extremely helpful to have someone familiar with the process who knows how to maneuver.**
