**At first it seemed pricey, but it was absolutely worth it.**

It was a breeze scheduling my strategy session with Josh. And it gave me a sense of confidence I've never had before when going into both a job interview and negotiation process. We were able to touch on everything from very small, specific questions I had, to large questions that have implications on my overall career and reputation.

Three great benefits of my strategy session were:

1.  Josh validated some of the decisions I've made up to this point.
2.  Josh empowered me to be able to make my own decisions about the negotiation process when it comes.
3.  Josh didn't sugar coat his feedback to me when I answered a practice interview question, which was great.

**I'd strongly recommend working with Josh.** I'm glad I did so relatively early on in my career so I can apply what I learned throughout my career. That being said, I'm confident that even the most seasoned professional could stand to learn something from a session with him.
