 **Josh helped me negotiate with Alphabet to get an additional $160k in annual compensation.**
 
 It's like professional sports — if you don't have film on your opponent and you go into a game without any scouting report, you're in big trouble. **Josh has 'the film' on Alphabet and other tech companies. He knows who you're dealing with and that's a huge advantage.**
 
 Bringing on Josh made a huge difference for me — no way I would have ended up with that number without his help. **Whether you're a mid-level engineer or an executive — to me it's a no brainer to work with Josh.**

It takes a lot of the anxiety out of the process.
