**The University of Florida's Career Showcase was the week after Josh's talk, and a number of students were able to translate Josh’s strategies into successful interviews.**

The University of Florida Career Showcase was a week away, and Josh spoke to my Engineering students on how to excel in their job interviews. The students were incredibly engaged, eager to find out strategies for interviewing.

He spoke on a pertinent topic for my students with clarity, a wealth of knowledge and enthusiasm. He was able to simplify complex ideas and present them in a manner that was easy for the student to remember and implement.

Students often comment that they are pursuing engineering to help people, and Josh is a perfect example of how to do this.

I will bring Josh in again next year, and I have recommended him to the University of Florida College of Engineering to help all of our Gator Engineers excel in their job intervies.

I believe Josh’s speaking abilities along with his knowledge and preparation would make him adept at any speaking engagement.
