 Before I hired Josh, I thought, "I've watched all of his Youtube videos, what's the value add of actually working with him?" **I doubt I would have had the confidence to make a 20% counteroffer without walking through Josh's process with him.** On top of gaining more financial freedom and the freedom to relocate, I'm confident that I'm not leaving money on the table.
product: Salary Negotiation Coaching

I wasn't sure how to effectively counteroffer. Before I hired Josh, I thought, **"Why don't I just use his free email templates? I've watched all of his Youtube videos, what's the value add of actually working with him?"**

It went great! It was very helpful to rehearse and bounce ideas off of someone else. **I doubt I would have had the confidence to make a 20% counteroffer without walking through Josh's process with him.** Josh provided excellent and thorough service, and I appreciated how organized he was. I was juggling a few different timelines, and Josh worked with me on each of the positions and gave me the language to help expedite the different timelines.

**With Josh's help, I negotiated $5K more base salary, $5K more annual bonus, and the freedom to relocate.** I know that I'm not leaving money on the table, and I'm confident to help friends negotiate their own job offers.
