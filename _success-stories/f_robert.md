**I was worried about how to deal with the expected salary question, which led me to do a strategy session with Josh.** My main concern was whether the session would deliver a return on investment.


It turned out to be a good investment! With Joshâ€™s help, I negotiated an offer with Google for $7,000 higher salary, a $10,000 signing bonus, and $24,000 in equity, which was an offer I was able to accept comfortably.


What I liked most about the strategy session was getting clear, firm answers to questions. Working with Josh helped increased my confidence in the negotiation process. I also benefited from the PDF materials that were included, especially the email templates.

I recommend working with Josh. His services are a good investment, particularly for young professionals.
