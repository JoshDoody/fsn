**Because of _Fearless Salary Negotiation_ I got an extra $25,000 in salary...which means it could be realistic for my family to stay here instead of having to move somewhere cheaper.**

I purchased _Fearless Salary Negotiation_ several weeks ago a day before my call with the recruiter to start the salary negotiation for a job with a new company. I followed the steps as closely as possible.

Their first offer was $10,000 above my "reach goal" which I had not disclosed. I countered twice and ended up getting an extra $15,000 on top of their first offer. Because of _Fearless Salary Negotiation_ I got an extra $25,000 in salary and doubled my stock grant.

Now I can consider buying a house in the Bay Area within the next two years, which means it could be realistic for my family to stay here instead of having to move somewhere cheaper.
