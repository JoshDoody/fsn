 I hired Josh because I didn't want to leave money on the table. **I negotiated a $10k sign-on bonus and $7k more in base salary.** I feel it adds more credibility to my own worth – and I know I shouldn't use a number to justify my self-worth, but it helps :)

I hired Josh because **I didn't want to leave money on the table**. Through working with him, I learned about salary ranges and levels and how to write a salary negotiation email.

I appreciated Josh's turnaround time, his clarity of explanations and justification for what we asked for in the negotiation, and the honesty of his services.

I'd recommend Josh's salary negotiation coaching because it's effective and he delivers results in an honest way. It was a pleasure working with him and I hope to do so again!
