I must thank you for the email templates. I am not your typical client, but I have been able to use many of your templates during my job search and they have been very helpful.

I have had to **decline a few offers**, **respond to a low-ball offer**, and **negotiate an offer while another offer was on the table**--all using advise from your articles and email templates.

I will recommend your help to friends!
