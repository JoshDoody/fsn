**I just landed a new remote position with a significantly higher salary than I was making before.**

I talked with several companies, growing as a developer and learning from each new opportunity. As I encountered new questions, I was able to use Joshâ€™s techniques to give better and better answers and portray myself as _the_ front end software developer they were looking for.

I used a lot of the advice I have read in Josh's newsletter, on the Interview Cheat Sheet, and in his Kalzumeus podcast episode, and in the positioning materialâ€”how I could provide value to the company, how I could become effective the day I startedâ€”that got companies fired up about me the most.

Once I got this offer, I even used his lowball salary negotiation technique to significantly improve it. Thank you from my two kids, my fiancee, and I ðŸ™‚
