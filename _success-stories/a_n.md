  I was originally offered $165,000 in base salary. As a result of negotiation, I received $170,000 plus an additional $5,000 signing bonus. Even beyond the salary negotiation per se, **I found that having a coach guiding me made an otherwise anxiety-ridden process so much easier.** My situation was particularly complicated because I used a third-party recruitment firm and they were adding unnecessary pressure and noise. Having an experienced negotiator helped clear the fog. I'd absolutely recommend working with Josh for **peace of mind, confidence in negotiation, and avoiding silly mistakes**.

I was worried about leaving money at the table. Initial salaries get compounded the longer you stay at a company (and even as you move companies) and I didn't want to be low balled.

Josh's service fee of $3,000 is high. I was moving from a particularly low-paying job and $3,000 was more than half of my monthly take-home pay. I understand that it's a worthwhile investment, but **one worry I had was that the negotiation won't yield results or a result that is less than the service fee**.

I was originally offered $165,000 in base salary. As a result of negotiation, I received $170,000 plus an additional $5,000 signing bonus.

Even beyond the salary negotiation per se (which was excellent and yielded results), **I found that having a coach guiding me throughout the process made an otherwise anxiety-ridden process _so much easier_**. My situation was particularly complicated because I used a third-party recruitment firm and they were adding unnecessary pressure and noise. Having an experienced negotiator helped clear the fog and put things into perspective. I really liked Josh's quick turnaround on deliverables â€” email drafts, opinion and advice, even jumping on a phone call in one "emergency" situation.

The experience also made me realize my own market value (I wasn't sure whether my walk away number is unrealistic). **I also came away with a better understanding of how to be intentional about career growth and of how to navigate the job search _before_ getting to the offer stage** (e.g. avoid 3rd party recruiters, never state a target salary)

I'd absolutely recommend working with Josh for **peace of mind, confidence in negotiation, and avoiding silly mistakes** (like giving the impression that you'd settle for a lower than market value offer).
