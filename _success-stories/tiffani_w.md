I signed up for a strategy session when I had an offer in hand to strategize about. I was initially focused on increasing my base but I realized through the process that work-life balance and a shorter commute were more important to me. So I negotiated in a way that would give me more work-life balance.

I appreciated having someone to discuss negotiation strategies with and someone to get feedback on what I was thinking. And our conversations made me more confident in the negotiation process and more realistic about what I could achieve from the situation.

I recommend working with Josh as a Salary Negotiation Coach because he has more experience negotiating salary and it helps to get expert insight into how to best negotiate a particular outcome.
