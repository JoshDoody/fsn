   My main concern about hiring Josh was the limited online references and external reviews.
   
   I was satisfied with the results. Through the coaching I found that politeness together with boldness can bring big gains. **I negotiated a more than $14k total compensation increase.** I got a sense of fulfilment and accomplishment for being able to successfully negotiate a salary increase. I was previously unable to, so making this happen this time was important for me.
