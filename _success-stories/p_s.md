 Perhaps the only concern I had about hiring Josh was that I hadn't seen a lot of personal references online and I was going off Patrick McKenzie's word on Twitter alone. But it went well! I negotiated a $25,000 signing bonus.

**Having not interviewed recently, I wasn't sure how to approach the negotiation.** Perhaps the only concern I had about hiring Josh was that I hadn't seen a lot of personal references online and I was going off Patrick McKenzie's word on Twitter alone.

But it went well! **I negotiated a $25,000 signing bonus.**

I liked that working with Josh was very structured and that he kept on top of communication, nudging me often (but gently) in the right direction.

I would definitely recommend this to more engineers as Josh clearly had a lot of experience that he brings to the table.
