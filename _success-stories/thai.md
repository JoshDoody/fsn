**I wasn’t sure if the value was there but now that I’ve taken it I can say that EVERYONE should take this course.**

I wanted to make sure I wasn’t leaving money on the table and that I knew what my manager and company were looking for to give me a raise. This course taught me _exactly_ what I needed to know, and Josh gave great answers to all of my questions about my specific situation.

Now I know that preparing for a raise is not difficult or overwhelming with the right guidance and the systemic process I learned in this course.
