   Having Josh as a partner through the negotiation was priceless. **These life changing decisions need to be thoroughly thought through and Josh helped me on that every step of the way.**
   
   We negotiated about **$75K more in salary**; however that was not what I needed to take the role. **Josh never pushed me to take it. He genuinely helped me think through what was best for me and my family.** I ended up declining the offer, but having the coaching throughout the process gave me confidence and ultimately helped support my decision to walk away. 
   
   **I will engage Joshâ€™s consulting services again when I get the next offer!**

I was worried about leaving money on the table. When I considered hiring Josh, **my main concern was** **how to quantify the economic upside vs. negotiating on my own.**

There were several things I appreciated about our work together. The step-by-step approach to the negotiation process helped me internalize what the employer was actually able to offer. Bouncing off ideas with Josh gave me confidence in my position to negotiate. He also helped me craft email responses with the appropriate positioning and language and he showed me how to manage that final call where I declined the offer, but kept the door open for future opportunities.
