 My past negotiations have honestly been terrible where I never felt like I had the upper hand. Josh's coaching gave me confidence in the negotiation process. Because I knew Josh had gone through this before, I knew I wasn't asking anything too crazy / offensive of Apple. We ended up negotiating **$35,000 more in base salary, $300,000 more total equity (vesting over four years), and $25,000 more sign on bonus**.

I felt I was on the high end of my bracket already with Google, and I wanted to make sure I could get at least as much in my negotiation with Apple.

Apple came in low with their original offer, so Josh helped me bring the offer up to a level that I could accept. We ended up negotiating **$35,000 more in base salary, $300,000 more total equity (vesting over four years), and $25,000 more sign on bonus**.

My past negotiations have honestly been terrible where I never felt like I had the upper hand. Josh's coaching gave me confidence in the negotiation process. **Because I knew Josh had gone through this before, I knew I wasn't asking anything too crazy / offensive of Apple.** I got to see first-hand how much I could press and **I feel I did get the best offer I could from Apple**.

Working with Josh was a fantastic experience. I appreciated his attentiveness, thoughtfulness, as well as his reassurances along the way. I felt it was a collaborative experience where he really was coaching. **I got to see what Josh was thinking and why approaches were taken.** It wasn't a complete "black box".

Josh's personal attention, collaborative nature, and coaching style is very approachable for anyone. Folks will learn a lot from working with him.
