I wanted to briefly say thank you for your resources on _Fearless Salary Negotiation_.

It was a tremendous help to me in my executive compensation package which was already pretty impressive.

I didn't accept the initial offer as tempting as it was. I countered with the worksheet. Even though I countered and didn't get my counter, **I was able to get an additional $5k added to my base by simply asking**.

**That $5k has the potential for another $3.5K in additional performance compensation which is almost $8.5-9k more dollars.**

It matters. Thanks for helping take some of the emotion and fear of losing it all out of the process when you get to this stage of the negotiation.
