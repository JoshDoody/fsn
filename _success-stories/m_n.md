Hi Josh,

I wanted to let you know, your email template helped me land a job. I was a small business owner for past 6 years and since last year was on the downfall and Covid 19 was the final nail. I started applying for jobs because I have business line of credit loan and office building construction loan. **Getting this job was necessary.**

I started applying for jobs and had an interview last week. I got an offer on Monday which was 20k below my expected range. I was not sure how to respond back, so I googled for counter offer letter and your link came up. **Using your template and modifying it to suit me, I was able to get 22k more than what they offered.** I start my new job next week.

So from the bottom of my heart THANK YOU. You are providing a great service.
