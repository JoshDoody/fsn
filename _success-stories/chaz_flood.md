I am absolutely blown away by Salary Negotiation Mastery! Not only did I find it incredibly valuable and useful, but I had the pleasure of seeing the results first hand. **I was able to negotiate a $22,000 increase in total compensation - that's a $13,000 increase in base salary and a $9,000 sign-on bonus - from Amazon!** 

I was so impressed with the results that **I even tried my hand at negotiating a consulting contract and was able to negotiate a $37/hr increase, totaling $76,960 in contract value!** And while I am beyond happy with the results, I can only imagine how much higher I could have negotiated had I followed the course material to a T. **Josh, Salary Negotiation Mastery is truly a game changer and I am recommending it to all my software engineering and software development contacts!**
