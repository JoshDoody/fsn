  Working with Josh was amazing and I have already recommended him to several other engineers. Having someone who knows how these companies operate and what normal looks like in a hiring process was one of the most valuable things to me.  

  **We negotiated $30,000 additional total comp.** My comp when I started working with Josh was $165k annually. **My new comp is 2.5x that amount.** I don't know what to do with the extra money. I guess I'm going to invest it and maybe donate some to non profits I'm affiliated with.

I reached out to Josh because I was concerned about **managing the timeline of multiple offers**. Because Patrick McKenzie endorsed him, I wasn't worried about his value proposition, but I did have concerns about my cash flow to pay for the coaching.

The process was significantly less stressful than it would have been by myself. **Having someone who knows how these companies operate and what normal looks like in a hiring process was one of the most valuable things to me.** Having someone to push me to negotiate even when it felt uncomfortable was also really valuable.

**We negotiated $30,000 additional total comp.** In year 1 that was almost all cash, year two a split of stock and RSU, and years three and four entirely RSUs. My comp when I started working with Josh was $165k annually. **My new comp is 2.5x that amount.** I don't know what to do with the extra money. I guess I'm going to invest it and maybe donate some to non profits I'm affiliated with.
