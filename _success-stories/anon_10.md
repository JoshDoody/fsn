 The coaching cost was a concern for me. Josh's result fee makes sense, but **the $3,000 service fee is not inexpensive**. It was well worth it. Josh helped me negotiate an extra $3,000 in base salary, $40,000 in extra sign-on over two years, and around $32,000 in extra equity over 4 years. **That's roughly $84,000 in extra income over four years.** I also now have a better understanding of the negotiating process and the confidence to handle this myself next time.

The coaching cost was a concern for me. Josh's result fee makes sense, but **the $3,000 service fee is not inexpensive**.

It was well worth it. **I got exactly what I wanted.** Josh helped me negotiate an extra $3,000 in base salary to hit the cap, $40,000 in extra sign-on over two years, and around $32,000 in extra equity over four years. **That's roughly $84,000 in extra income over four years.**

**It went so smoothly that part of me thought, did I really need to hire Josh?** But then I realized that of course I did. I had no idea what I was doing or how to frame the counter offer or how to act after they came with theirs. Having the offer pulled for asking for too much was a huge worry of mine, especially since I had no competing offers. **Josh understood where I was coming from and helped put me at ease.** He helped me overcome my hesitation to counteroffer and basically assured me that the recruiter expected it.

Working with Josh made me confident that I got a good deal and that I wasn't lowballed. Had I kept my original offer, I would've always had a small chip on my shoulder that I got played. **Not having that feeling is almost priceless.** I also now have a better understanding of the negotiating process and the confidence to handle this myself next time.
