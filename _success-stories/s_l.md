I had an opportunity to move to Europe as a **Google** Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) and I knew I should negotiate, but wasn't sure exactly how to do it.

I'm glad I worked with Josh. Now I have greater confidence to negotiate other job offers in the future, and I found that it's possible to ask for more and go further than I'm used to.
