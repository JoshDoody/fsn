 I had a lot of people tell me this would pay for itself in increased wages. **My total compensation literally doubled as a direct result of this engagement. Beyond that, I negotiated $25k more total compensation and $15k more sign-on bonus.** I owe a few beers to the people who recommended Josh to me :)

I had a lot of people tell me this would pay for itself in increased wages. I wasn't super concerned about working with Josh, though I was worried I'd end up pressured to "play hardball" more than I was comfortable with.

I found Josh was pleasant, easy to work with and got me lot of additional income in extra salary, bonus and equity.

**My total compensation literally doubled as a direct result of this engagement. Beyond that, I negotiated $25k more total compensation and $15k more sign-on bonus.** I'll have significantly more financial freedom after a few years at this job.

I've already started referring a few engineers I know Josh's way. Also, I owe a few beers to the people who recommended Josh to me :)
