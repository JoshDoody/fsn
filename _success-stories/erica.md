  I did not want to get to my next job and realize I came in too low or underleveled because I didn't believe in myself or thought I would prove myself after I was hired rather than entering at my value. **With Josh's inside knowledge of how leveling works, I was able to hit pause on an L6 offer and inception my way to an L7 over six months.** In the negotiation, we left NOTHING on the table. NOTHING. I negotiated for an additional **$80k signing bonus, or $40k a year**.

I did not want to get to my next job and realize I came in too low or underleveled because I didn't believe in myself or thought I would prove myself after I was hired rather than entering at my value.

**With Josh's inside knowledge of how leveling works, I was able to hit pause on an L6 offer and inception my way to an L7 over six months.** He gave me the best advice on how to put it in the hiring manager's ear and walked me through being patient, because it was going to take a while.

**In the negotiation, we left NOTHING on the table. NOTHING. I negotiated for an additional $80k signing bonus, or $40k a year.**  I'm not underleveled, underpaid, or underappreciated. Now I can just focus on providing the value that I promise, not worrying about whether or not I got a fair deal. The level raise also changes where I sit in the tech recruiting landscape and opens all kinds of strategic and leadership opportunities.

Josh coached me objectively in a way that friends, family, and colleagues were hesitant to do. Friends always say, 'Oh, I want what you want.' Thatâ€™s kind, but I want to know what is going to make me happy and what's going to challenge me and take me where I want to go. You need to pay somebody for that information apparently, and **it's worth it because everyone else just wants to be a friend and make you happy, but Josh wants you to win.**
