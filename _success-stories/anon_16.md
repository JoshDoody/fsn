  The coaching fee isn't a small cost and I was worried I'd spend money for nothing since I wasn't sure if I would be accepting an offer. I really needed a big jump up in compensation to convince me to leave where I was. I ended up accepting the position and **I got a 6x return on my investment in year one alone.** I now feel comfortable leaving my job of more than 20 years.

Working with Josh went great! I ended up accepting the position and **I got a 6x return on my investment in year one alone**. I now feel comfortable leaving my job of more than 20 years.

I learned about what goes into negotiation but had the benefit of **a pro doing the research on the market, salary ranges, etc and then writing the offers, counters and giving me scripts and email templates.** I also got some good phrasing to use when pushing back against the aggressive start date.

The only way it could have gone better is if I could have put Josh on with the recruiter when she insisted on always calling versus relying on email. **But Josh was available to talk with me over the phone to help me be prepared for those calls.** I also appreciated talking through it at the end to confirm we weren't overlooking anything or leaving something on the table made me confident to accept. I would totally recommend working with Josh for salary negotiation coaching.
