 I’d heard the company I wanted to join made strong but fairly inflexible offers, and so I thought there may not be enough room to negotiate to make up for the up-front coaching fee. But I decided to work with Josh anyway and got a great outcome. The company made a strong initial offer and **with Josh's help, we added an additional $100k in bonuses — a $50k signing bonus and a $50k second-year bonus**.

### "I was feeling uncertain..."

I was feeling uncertain about establishing a fair market price for my fairly senior and specialized skill set. The market seems pretty strong but just how strong is hard to tell. My other concern was whether I should make the significant investment of time and energy to bring multiple prospects to the point of making an offer or instead concentrate first on my preferred choice.

**I'd heard that my most preferred option made strong but fairly inflexible offers, and so I thought there may not be enough room to negotiate to make up for the up-front coaching fee.** And, where the company tended to move, it seemed to be primarily through a signing bonus, which would make Josh's performance fee relatively more expensive compared to, for example, an improvement in ongoing salary. I had also previously read Josh's book and it was good but most of the advice was not new to me, although I found the formula for counteroffers was novel and very good.

### A $100k improvement

Despite these hesitations, I decided to work with Josh and got a great outcome. The company we negotiated with made a strong initial offer: over the next 4 years it may be worth $1M+ more than my current job. **With Josh's help, we added an additional $100k in bonuses — a $50k signing bonus and a $50k second-year bonus.**

I think given their strong need for someone with my skill set and information that I previously had about how they structured their offers, I might have got the second-round offer (+$80k) out of them without Josh's assistance. But **I don't think I would have had the confidence to stick in for the third round**, which gave an additional $20k improvement. So one way to look at it is that I paid Josh $8k to get a $20k improvement beyond the likely alternative case, which is still very positive.

I appreciated a lot of things about Josh's coaching, including:

*   His **insights into the likely mindset or position of our counterparty** and additional information about other offers he had seen from the company.
*   **Getting assurance** that my current employer was a reasonable BATNA and therefore it was not necessary to do the more complicated work of trying to get multiple simultaneous offers.
*   Josh's **positive, reassuring, competent** manner.
*   The **prompt to restate my qualifications** for the job when asking for an improved offer, which probably worked well but definitely felt uncomfortably immodest to me.
*   The **structure of suggested emails** that I could rewrite into my own voice.

Now that it's all settled, I think this will be a very good, energizing and refreshing step in my career. I had some hesitation about walking away from my current job, but **knowing that I got a good deal and having additional compensation for RSUs I'm walking away from helped me decide to make the change**.

I would recommend Josh to a friend, for all the reasons I mentioned. **In higher pay ranges, the fee is moderate compared to the amounts at stake.**
