**I am so fired up! The Salary Negotiation Crash Course totally worked!**

I work as an inside sales rep and I was offered $22/hour to move to a comparable job at a competitor. After asking for a couple of days to review and then using the **Standard Counter Offer Email Template** to counter with $27/hour, they came back with $24.50.

**This represents $7,000 more annually** than they were offering initially for a 50 hour week!

Big win, thank you, The Salary Negotiation Crash Course totally worked!
