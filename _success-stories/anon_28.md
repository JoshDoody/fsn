   I haven't negotiated in 15 years so I had no idea what to expect/how to even approach it! **My concern was the value/cost of hiring someone vs. trying to do it myself**. Josh got me additional cash AND helped me navigate the process. **He told me what to expect and how to approach every situation that arose.** I negotiated **an additional 50K in cash** as part of a sign on bonus. **I feel confident I'm not leaving anything on the table**, I feel much more knowledgeable about the process, and I feel like I'm starting my new job off on the right foot.
