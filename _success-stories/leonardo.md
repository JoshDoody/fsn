 I weighed the cost/benefit of hiring Josh. **There are other far less expensive options and I believe I could have done pretty well negotiating myself, but you tend to “get what you pay for”.**
 
 The process was enjoyable, Josh was quick to help, and the results were strong. I ended up with **a $50k+ increase in compensation year one** and I have a good four-year outlook that I’m happy with.

I was switching industries and was worried about dealing with a totally different comp package at Amazon.

I weighed the cost/benefit of hiring Josh. **There are other far less expensive options and I believe I could have done pretty well negotiating myself, but you tend to “get what you pay for”.** In our preliminary calls, Josh added a lot of value and insight at no cost, which showed who he was as a person and ultimately made me want to work with him.

It went great! The process was enjoyable, Josh was quick to help, and the results were strong. **I ended up with a $50k+ increase in compensation year one and I have a good four-year outlook that I’m happy with.**

I'd recommend hiring Josh to help with salary negotiation because of his knowledge, approach, and depth of experience with Amazon.
