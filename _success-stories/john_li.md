When I started the course, I was earning $75k. I’ve used what I learned in this course again and again over the last four years to **negotiate several compensation increases ranging between $15k and $40k/year**. It’s been a huge part of reaching where I am today—**earning 400% more in total compensation** than when I first took the course.

I’ve used the skills and techniques I learned in this course **again and again over the last four years**. It’s been a huge part of reaching where I am today**—earning 400% more in total compensation** than when I first took the course.

When I first started the course, I was earning $75k. **I wanted a raise, but didn’t know where to start.** Josh’s course walked me through a simple process to prepare my case and ask for a raise. Each lesson had specific action items for me to make steady progress, and I got feedback on my work plus great answers to my questions every step of the way.

Since taking the course, **I’ve negotiated several compensation increases ranging between $15k and $40k/year at different companies**. At one role, negotiating helped me reach $210k/year in total compensation, which was the top-of-band salary and stock offered. Most recently, I negotiated for an extra $40k in RSUs before accepting an offer with Twitter.
