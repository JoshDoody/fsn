  Josh helped me get the strongest possible offer. It wound up being pretty close to the initial offer, but **I got a higher signing bonus (+$15,000 over the original offer)**. It was really helpful to have someone I could trust to check in and get an opinion. **I feel a lot better about starting my new job knowing that I’m at the top of the salary band.** I don’t feel like I’m trying to play catch-up to where I “should” be valued.

I knew going into the negotiation that we were discussing a huge jump in comp from what I was earning. It was a different world for me so I wanted someone on my side who had experience with negotiation.

**Josh helped me get the strongest possible offer from my new employer.** It wound up being pretty close to the initial offer, but **I got a higher signing bonus (+$15,000 over the original offer)**. The increase will allow me to have a much larger and more elaborate wedding than I was previously planning.

It was really helpful to have someone I could trust to check in and get an opinion. I also liked the exercise of writing the “brag bullets” for the counteroffer. I’m not used to advocating for myself in that way.
