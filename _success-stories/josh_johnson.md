  Having a professional involved allows me to not overthink and overanalyze the process. I can throw out ideas, have them approved or not, **without having to spend hours and hours agonizing** over the decision tree. With Josh’s help, **I negotiated $30k more salary, $50k more bonus, and $100k more equity.**
  
  I always try and convince folks to hire Josh. I consider myself above average at negotiation (and some of that was learned from Josh and his book), but I would still much rather have the guidance of a professional to get the max comp offer and peace of mind.

I had extremely limited visibility into my market value, so I hired Josh to help me negotiate.

Working with Josh was excellent! Having a professional involved allows me to not overthink and overanalyze the process. I can throw out ideas, have them approved or not, **without having to spend hours and hours agonizing over the decision tree.**

I always try to convince folks to hire Josh. The biggest obstacle is that (IMO) people are irrationally cheap or over-value their own negotiation skills. I consider myself above average at negotiation (and some of that was learned from Josh and his book), but I would still much rather have the guidance of a professional to get the max comp offer and peace of mind.
