**The extra 17% base salary I negotiated allowed me to save up a cash reserve so I had greater peace of mind.**

I had concerns about the value of this sort of coaching, but I quickly found that Josh has thought through all of the processes and has great insight to something that’s very important and that I seldom do.

By working with him, I negotiated an additional 17% in base salary, gained confidence in my negotiating ability, and immediately improved my career trajectory.

I definitely recommend working with Josh to negotiate your salary.
