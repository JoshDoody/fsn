 Having Josh as a coach meant that I had a like-minded individual on my side who is an advocate and has a rooting interest in my outcome. I negotiated $8,000 more in the base pay salary, which directly increased my annual bonus payout target (as the percentage is tied to the base pay), plus $10,000 more in RSUs.

**Although I was a bit hesitant about the upfront cost/investment of coaching**, I hired Josh because I was concerned about leaving money on the table by not maximizing my earning potential.

As expected, Josh helped me get a better offer. **I negotiated $8,000 more in the base salary, which directly increased my annual bonus payout target (as the percentage is tied to the base pay), plus $10,000 more in RSUs.**

Having Josh as a coach meant that I had a like-minded individual on my side who is an advocate and has a rooting interest in my outcome. I was able to negotiate better and now have more of a process than I did before.

I appreciated the handholding, patience and advocacy Josh provided, as well as the phone calls, email responses, and documentation throughout the whole entire process.

**I would 100%, absolutely, without a doubt recommend working with Josh!**
