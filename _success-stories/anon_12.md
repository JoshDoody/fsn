  **I got an initial offer that was low relative to the market rate.** The recruiter was stern during initial salary negotiations over the phone. Working with Josh, I gained lots of confidence and insights into key drivers going into negotiations. He helped me write down my specific skill sets that are relevant to the job and then carefully build those into a counteroffer. **We increased my baseline salary by $10,000, my 1st-year bonus by $9,000 and 2nd-year bonus by $5,000.**

**I got an initial offer that was low relative to the market rate.** The recruiter was stern during initial salary negotiations over the phone, even after data points were shared. I Google searched "lowball salary" and Josh Doody showed up in the top ten results.

Josh is action-oriented and knows the key talking points during negotiations. He helped me write down my specific skill sets that are relevant to the job and then carefully build those into a counteroffer. **We increased my baseline salary by $10,000, my 1st-year bonus by $9,000 and 2nd-year bonus by $5,000.** 

Working with Josh, I gained lots of confidence and insights into key drivers going into negotiations. Data points are useful, but didn't influence the negotiation outcome. I learned to focus on key skill sets that'll contribute to the success of the employer, then justify by crafting a carefully thought-out counteroffer letter. **I will use skill sets and tools learned from Josh for future negotiations.**

I'd recommend working with Josh. HR staff speaks from a position of strength. They deal with job offers daily and part of their performance metric is to save money. Therefore, job seekers are at a disadvantage. Professional help is needed.
